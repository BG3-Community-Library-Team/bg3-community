# Tabs - How To
<!-- add some fancy text here if you want to -->

## Tab {.tabset}
### Step One
Convert your page to the markdown editor - if you convert back to the visual editor, the tabs won't work.
Tabs are only available in the markdown editor, and are rendered upon saving.
### Step Two
Create your tabset header - this will be the name of your tabs - use header 1 (one # before the title)
In this example the tabset header is "Tabs - How To".
### Step Three
Now you need to tell the wiki to create tabs - you do this by creating a header 2 called "Tab" followed by "{.tabset}".
This is how my full header looks in markdown:
"## Tab {.tabset}"
### Step Four
Create your tab names - your tab names need to be one header designation below the tabset header. So if your tabset header is header 2(two ### before the title), the tab names need to be header 3(three ### before the title).
My tab names are: "Step one", "Step Two", "Step Three", "Step Four", "Step Five" and "Template".
### Step Five
If you want to add content below the tabset, create a new header with the same designation as the tabset header.
In this example: "## Next Section"

### Template
Conveniently for you, I'll include a sort of template. Simply copy / paste the below code into your markdown editor, rename the tabs, and remove or add tabs according to your vision.

```
# Tabs - How To
## Tab {.tabset}
### Step One
### Step Two
### Step Three
### Step Four
### Step Five
## Next Section
```

## Next Section
<!-- add some more fancy text, I recommend questionable poetry -->
