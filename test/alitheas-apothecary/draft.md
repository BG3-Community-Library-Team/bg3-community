# Restore Astarion's Appearance or something catchy

## Why?

Astarion's body textures were changed with Patch 4 but I, among others, very much prefer his original appearance. Unlike already available mods that restore the old textures, virtual textures do not rely on old shaders.

## How?

### Tools

- BG3 Modder's Multitool to index base game files
- Norbyte's LSLib v.1.19.0 or higher for Virtual Texture support to create gps/gpr files and pak the mod
- VS Code
