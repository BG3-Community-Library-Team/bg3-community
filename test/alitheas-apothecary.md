# Welcome

This is the BG3 Modding Community Wiki. A space where tutorials, resources, and guides can be easily found, created, and modified. Lore and base game information are also welcome. All content here is posted with the author’s consent. If you’d like to get involved, this is how:

## Getting Access
The first step toward being able to submit content involves Gaining Access and permissions. To submit content to the wiki, you need a user account, and the Contributor Role.

### Signing Up
The Modding Wiki uses Auth0 as a sign-in service, providing more security around your credentials, alerting you and/or preventing sign-up if your credentials are found to be compromised - prompting you to change your credentials. Auth0 ensures that we have no access to your login information, reducing risk in case of a security breach.

Once you have an account, you'll have guest permissions, identical to before having been signed up. Guest permissions allow you to read any page on the Wiki. 

### Contributor Role
Once you're ready, contact the Administrative Team with your account name, and we’ll grant you the necessary role. You have three options to do this:

1. If you're part of the BG3 Modding Community Discord, send a message to ModMail requesting Contributor Access.
2. If you're part of the BG3 Modding Community Discord, Ping the @Admin role, requesting Contributor Access.
3. Otherwise, send an email to wiki@bg3.community, requesting Contributor Access.
