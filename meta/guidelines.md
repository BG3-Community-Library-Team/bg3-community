# Policies and Guidelines
BG3 Modding Community is adamant about creating a safe, accessible place for modders of all shapes and stripes to gather, collaborate, and learn. To that end, it's important to set up a few simple rules for all of us (even, and especially, the administration and mod team) to abide by when writing and editing Wiki pages. We also need a set of standard practices, to help ensure the content on the Wiki is as useful as possible.


## Behavior Guidelines 
1. Bigotry is not acceptable. Black people are not a threat to your safety. Trans women are women, and trans men are men. Nonbinary folk are valid. Someone's faith does not decide their worth, nor does the color of their skin or their sexuality. If bigoted behavior comes up in the comments *or* in someone's guide, the content will be removed, as will the offending person.

2. Assume good faith. It's important to assume that people have good intentions when they edit, comment, or post, even when they make a mistake. We have to believe people want ot help the community, so we're very open with who can get Contributor permissions. To that end, we should also be patient with new editors, and help them along. Community is part of the Wiki name for a reason.

3. No vandalism, trolling, harrassment, brigading, or advocating harm or death on others, whether they're users/contributors of the Wiki or not. This behavior is not tolerated.

4. Respect authors' wishes. If an author does not want their content hosted on this Wiki, don't post it here in their stead. If an author doesn't want their content placed elsewhere, don't repost it. If an author wishes to remove their content from the wiki, they are welcome to. As this is a wiki, content is subject to be modified to keep things current.

5. The BG3MC Wiki doesn't allow bot trawlers in order to curb AI indexing any hosted content. The Wiki is not a farm for AI to be trained on, please do not run other people's guides through AI such as ChatGPT.

Administrators and moderators reserve the right to ban/remove content if they deem it necessary. Questions or concerns can be sent to wiki@bg3.community.
