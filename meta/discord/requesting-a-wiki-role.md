# Requesting Discord Roles
The Discord server has a few roles that can be requested.

## Wiki
The following template is a lightly edited example provided by Ã†ther. 


[Description of what you've created, what you intend to create, and what you've edited].

### New Pages
[**Shipping Items to Users**](https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/General/Shipping-Items-to-Users) - Complete
[**Notable NPCs**](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Information/Notable-NPCs) - Admittedly a work in progress, but I'm hoping that more authors will contribute to the page over time. My plans are to finish adding all of the Merchants to the page.

### Future Pages
How to create a Custom Container
How to use Aether's Container Templates

### Edits
[How to install manual/loose file mods](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-install-manual-or-loose-file-mods) - Complete rewrite of the beginning of the page's preamble, to include a more concise and understandable explanation of what loose file mods are.
