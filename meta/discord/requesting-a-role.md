# Requesting Discord Roles
The BG3 Modding Community Discord server has a few roles that can be requested.

To request a role in the Discord server, please send a message to Modmail using one of the following templates:

## Verified Mod Author
**Modmail Template**

Please include these two things in your message to Modmail, when requesting the Verified Mod Author Role.
- A sentence explaining who you are, and a request for the Verified Mod Author role.
- A link to one of your mods, or the account which you host all of your mods.

**Template Example**
```md
Hello! I'm Aetherpoint, and I believe I should have the Verified Mod Author role, as I've created and uploaded a mod to the Nexus!

https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Aetherpoint/mods
```

## Verified Screenarcher
**Modmail Template**

Please include these two things in your message to Modmail, when requesting the Verified Verified Screenarcher Role.
- A sentence explaining who you are, the screenshots you've taken, and a request for the Verified Screenarcher role.
- A link to one of your screenshots in the screen-archery channel, or the website which you host screenshots. 

Do not send the photos directly to Modmail, only include links to the photos.

**Template Example**
```md
Hi there! I'm Aetherpoint, and I've sent quite a few screenshots to the screen-archery channel, is it okay if I get the Verified Screenarcher role?

Here is the link to a couple of photos I've sent to the channel: https://discord.com/channels/1211056047784198186/1239975764405780633/1239983583909908490
```

## Wiki Contributor
**Modmail Template**
```md
Write a preamble here, explaining why you think you should have the Wiki Contributor Role.
### New Pages
[**Title of the Page goes here**](link to the page goes here) - Additional information.
### Future Pages
Title of the future page you wish to contribute to the wiki.
### Edits
[Page name which you have edited](link to the page you have edited) - An explanation for what you have edited on this page.
```
**Template Example**
```md
Hiyaaaa, I've finally created two pages, plan to make two more, and have done large edits to a third page.
### New Pages
[**Shipping Items to Users**](https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/General/Shipping-Items-to-Users) - Complete
[**Notable NPCs**](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Information/Notable-NPCs) - Admittedly a work in progress, but I'm hoping that more authors will contribute to the page over time. My plans are to finish adding all of the Merchants to the page.

[How to install manual/loose file mods](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-install-manual-or-loose-file-mods) - Complete rewrite of the beginning of the page's preamble, to include a more concise and understandable explanation of what loose file mods are.
