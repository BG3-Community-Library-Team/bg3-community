# Requesting Discord Roles
The Discord server has a few roles that can be requested.

## Wiki
To request the Wiki contributor role in the BG3 Modding Community Discord server, please send a message Modmail using the following template, provided by [Aetherpoint](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Aetherpoint). 

```md
Write a preamble here, explaining why you think you should have the Wiki Contributor Role.
### New Pages
[**Title of the Page goes here**](link to the page goes here) - Additional information.
### Future Pages
Title of the future page you wish to contribute to the wiki.
### Edits
[Page name which you have edited](link to the page you have edited) - An explanation for what you have edited on this page.
```

### Wiki Mod Mail Example
```md
Hiyaaaa, I've finally created two pages, plan to make two more, and have done large edits to a third page.
### New Pages
[**Shipping Items to Users**](https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/General/Shipping-Items-to-Users) - Complete
[**Notable NPCs**](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Information/Notable-NPCs) - Admittedly a work in progress, but I'm hoping that more authors will contribute to the page over time. My plans are to finish adding all of the Merchants to the page.
### Future Pages
How to create a Custom Container
How to use Aether's Container Templates
### Edits
[How to install manual/loose file mods](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-install-manual-or-loose-file-mods) - Complete rewrite of the beginning of the page's preamble, to include a more concise and understandable explanation of what loose file mods are.
