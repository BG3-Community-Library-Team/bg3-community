# Submitting Content

## Getting Access
The first step toward being able to submit content involves Gaining Access and permissions. To submit content to the wiki, you need a user account, and the Contributor Role.

### Signing Up
The Modding Wiki uses Auth0 as a sign-in service, providing more security around your credentials, alerting you and/or preventing sing-up if your credentials are found to be compromised - prompting you to change your credentials. Auth0 ensures that we have no access to your login information, reducing risk in case of a security breach.

Once you have an account, you'll have guest permissions, identical to before having been signed up. Guest permissions allow you to read any page on the Wiki. 

### Contributor Role
There are three ways to get this role.

1. If you're part of the BG3 Modding Community Discord, send a message to ModMail requesting Contributor Access.
2. If you're part of the BG3 Modding Community Discord, Ping the @Admin role, requesting Contributor Access.
3. Otherwise, send an email to wiki@bg3.community, requesting Contributor Access.

When requesting access, we'll need to know your Display Name so we grant access to the right person.
