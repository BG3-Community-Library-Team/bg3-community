# Dakeen
Originally planned as the Githduros^1^, the Dakeen were created by Matt Colvile for Liber Bestarius. 


### Canonocity
Githduros were mentioned during a Matt Colville Stream^3^:

> Hey- hey, are you a Gith? ... It's been a looong time since a Gith has come in here. Hey which kind of Gith are you? He's like 'Oh I bet I could guess cuz there's a couple right? There's like th-uhhh- there's the Githzerai ... and one goes yeah and there's the Githduros, and he goes no I think that one's a Githyanki

While Colville is associated with Critical Role, and Critical Role is canonical to D&D, this stream was in an unrelated campaign, and so is not likely canon.

## Background
The Dakeen were primarilly scouts, serving the aeon. Upon freeing themselves from extraplanar control, they became planar rangers, renowned for their skills across the multiverse^2^.
