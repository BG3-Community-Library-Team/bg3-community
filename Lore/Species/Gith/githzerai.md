# Githzerai

[TODO: Add Githzerai Lore]

## Zerth Freebooters
Traveling between Wildspace and Limbo, the Zerth Freebooters are followers of Zerthimon who took to the stars to combat Gith Pirates and Illithid Nautiloids. Freebooters appear more human than most Gith, with full noses and more pronounced bodies.

They cooperate with other races in Wildspace, but try to stick to themselves, focused more on eliminating the Pirates of Gith than finding allies. They often travel alongside Elves, as Gith Pirates tend to target Elven ships. While a subfaction of Githzerai, they rarely travel to  Limbo, and don't follow Githzerai leadership so much as they do the legends of Zerthimon. Despite this, Githzerai consider them heroes, and Zerths themselves consider the freebooters as equals^[1]^.
