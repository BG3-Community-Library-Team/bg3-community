# The Lost Gith
Some subspecies of Gith have had their information lost to time. These include the Githtorai and Githzada. Not much is known about these subspecies beyond their names.

# Githtorai
There was at one point information on the Githtorai mentioned in the Mystara Realms-L Archives, and an Illithid Player Character PDF download. Both sources no longer appear to be online.
