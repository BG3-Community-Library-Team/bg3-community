# Githtorai - The Lost Gith
There was at one point information on the Githtorai mentioned in the Mystara Realms-L Archives, and an Illithid Player Character PDF download. Both sources no longer appear to be online. Based on their name alone, it could be assumed that they're a splinter-group of the Githzerai, or perhapes a rival group of Gith offshoots.
