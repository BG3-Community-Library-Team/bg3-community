# The Lost Gith
Some Gith subspecies have been lost to time, either due to their creators going under, or sites and content disappearing over time. These include the Githtorai and the Githzada.

## Githtorai
There was at one point information on the Githtorai mentioned in the Mystara Realms-L Archives, and an Illithid Player Character PDF download. Both sources no longer appear to be online. ENWorld User Nellisir^[1]^ claims to have made them, inspired by the Kif of the Chanur novels by C.J. Cherryh, as scouts and hunters who remained in the Underdark to fight Illithids. Based on their name alone, it could be assumed that they're a splinter-group of the Githzerai, or perhapes a rival group of Gith offshoots.

## Githzada
The Githzada were an offshoot of the peoples enslaved by the Illithids, residing in the Astral. They were created by Fiend Games for a planned Project: Planeshifter, however Fiend Games closed up shop before releasing anything more than some titles and a preview article in Gaming Frontiers, Premiere Issue 00.
