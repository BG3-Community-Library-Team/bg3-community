# Githgagra
An offshoot of the race that would eventually become Githzerai, Githyanki, and others. Rather than following the other factions into the Astral, Limbo, or Arcane Space, Githgagra stayed in the Underdark to fight Illithids.

## Physiology
They are tall, long-limbed humanoids with large eyes and pale skin. They are generally Albino, and their eyes are usually on a gradient between blue and red. Generally thin-framed, and having sharp facial features and pointed eared, they have a reptilian bearing in their movement, as well as more pronounced reptilian features - their skin is scaly (which is due to hereditary icthyosis). They are still capable of laying eggs, but most carry their unborn within, like humans.

They have a form of psionic awareness that helps them keep aware in darkness, and are not easily surprised. They also have infravision. As with most Underdark denizens, they struggle with the bright sun on the surface.

## Society
They are allied with the Deep Gnomes, and have no friendship or trade with Drow, Dwarves, or Kuo-Toa. They often speak undercommon, common, duergar, derro, dwarf, drow, kuo-toa, illithid, and any gith language.

Githgagra have a keen sense of curiosity. They have special interest in humans, and ask them incessantly about their origins, much to the dismay of the questioned.

Githgagra are cautious of Githzerai, as they're too chaotic. They're hostile toward Githyanki. Regardless, they have academic interest in all Gith races and subraces, and will do whatever they can to learn more information[1].
