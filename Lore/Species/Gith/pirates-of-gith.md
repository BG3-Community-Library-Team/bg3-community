# Pirates of Gith
The Pirates of Gith diverged alongside Githyanki and Githzerai after freeing themselves from Illithid control. They opted to travel through Arcane Space rather than flee to the Astral or Limbo^[1]^. As with most Gith subgroups, they have the ability to Planeshift.

## Appearance
Gith Pirates look nearly identical to Githyanki, but can be distinguished by their clothing and choice of weapons - preferring scimitar and cutlass, and wearing the garish clothing you would expect on a sea-bound Pirate.

## Society
Considered to be among the most genocidal of Gith subgroups, the Pirates of Gith have a deep hatred not just of the Illithids, but also of the other Gith factions, particularly Githyanki. That said, the pirates are disparate, and there are a variety of Gith Pirate vessels with different approaches, and inter-pirate conflict is not uncommon.

The pirates of Gith consider Vlaakith a betrayer. They're thought to align themselves with Gith, but claim several Deities, including Tiamat, to be abberations of their own original deities. They speak a language distinct from other Gith languages, but often know Githyanki and Common as well.

They are found all over Wildspace, but are rumored to converge in the Golarion system's Diaspora asteroid belt, having hollowed out several of the asteroids^[2]^. Historical records are not well-kept by Gith Pirate Captains, so most knowledge about them is rumor^[3]^.

## Notable Factions
- Clerics of Gith
