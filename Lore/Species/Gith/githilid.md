# Gith'ilid
With sickly skin, sharp features, dark hair and simple clothing, you would easily assume them to be Githzerai touched by the Infernal. Their eyes are like "milky white orbs that reflect neither emotion not intent"^1^, and their chins are adorned with six braided, disguised tentacles, which can unbraid themselves and act as weapons in combat.

They are enthralled by renegade Alhoons - Mindflayer Necromancers that have severed their connection to the hive, and are born through a twisted variation of Ceromorphosis, forced upon fallen Illithid, known as Necromorphosis. They are capable of defensive Psionic abilities, and have a light immunity against telepathic attacks.


## Society

Gith'ilids aren't known to form societies. They are known to act in pairs, and will often disguise themselves as Githzerai, but will attack Gith on sight, seeking to avoid being identified as Gith'ilid.


They are hated by Illithid, Githzerai, and Githyanki alike - these have been records indicating that when Githyanki hunting parties are fighting against Illithids, should a Gith'ilid's presence be discovered, the Githyanki and Mindflayers will work together to end the Gith'ilid threat.

Gith'ilid inject enzymes into fallen Illithid, which create eggs upon the Mind Flayer's death. Upon bringing the eggs to their Alhoon, the tadpoles within the eggs manipulated with negative energy. The tadpoles are then transformed into young Githilid.
