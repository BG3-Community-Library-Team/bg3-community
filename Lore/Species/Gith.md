# Gith
The Gith comprise several factions of beings who have escaped Illithid control. Some lead lives as soldiers in a never-ending war, while others prefer a more chaotic monastical approach. All of them hate Mind Flayers with a passion^[1]^, and most hate each other nearly as much. The various types of Gith are more akin to subgroups, rather than subspecies.

## Notes on Canonocity
Planewalker and the Beyond the Moons source for Spelljammer are sources that have been given WotC's blessing to continue the Planescape and Spelljammer settings^[2]^^[3]^, and are effectively canonical sources. Project Planeshifter fell through when Fiend Games closed their doors^[4]^, so while it could be considered canon, the Githzada never saw the light of day. Similarly, the Dakeen were originally written as Githduros, until it was confirmed Gith would not be added to the SRD, and were reworkds into the Dakeen. Given Githyanki and Githzerai are the only Gith subgroups referenced in 5e, the information on them will be more accurate.
