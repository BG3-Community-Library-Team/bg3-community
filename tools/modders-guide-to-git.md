# A Modder's Guide to Git: A Primer on Version Control
Many mods for Baldur's Gate 3 are being uploaded on GitHub, and it's easy to see why that's the case: If you've looked through this repo, you can see everything that goes into the Community Library, without even needing to download it. Having a wiki attached means documentation is a step away, and reporting problems or requesting features is easy with the Issues tab. But how do you set it all up like this? What kind of technical know-how do you need? Why are other modders telling me to make a Pull Request, and how do I do that? These questions, and more, are what this guide aims to help you with.
