# Information

This section of the wiki is a centralized hub for information. It goes over BG3's game files, how they work, and how to edit them, as well as touching on what are considered 'best practices' in modding. Most, if not all, of the information here is unoffical, and has been gathered from fellow members of the modding community who were willing to share their knowledge and experience.

This area is not for tutorials but for general information. If you would like to know how to put this information into practice, please head over to the Tutorials section of the wiki.
<!-- For the sake of organisation the information here has been divided up into sections: **Core Information**, **Scripting**, **Gameplay**, **Meshes**, **Races**, **Textures**, **Sound**, and **Gameplay**. -->
