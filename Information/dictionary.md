Intended as a temporary hub for terms that may need to be explained in our work-in-progress dictionary. Very inclined by [this layout](https://eternity.obsidian.net/game-data-formats/concepts), but no decisions were made yet.

## A

-   Anubis - Larian scripting language
-	Attribute (Character Stats) - Attributes refer to character statistics such as Strength, Constitution, and others. These can be modified through various means, including templates, classes, and stats.
-	Attribute (Template) - An Attribute in the context of a template define its characteristics and functionality. For example, WalkOn = true allows characters to walk on it, CanShootThrough = false makes it impenetrable, and VisualEntry = "A UUID" links a VisualBank to a template.

## B

-   BG3MM - [LaughingLeader's Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager)
-   Boost - Boosts are similar to buffs or debuffs in other games. They can modify an entity in various ways or be re-utilized to trigger other things with Script Extender.

## C

-   Class (Coding) - In coding, a class is a blueprint for creating objects within Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It defines shared properties and methods of an object you create. For example, a class dedicated to an element/object would outline its properties and the functions available for it.

Each type can also be associated with a number, allowing it to be referenced by name or number, e.g., (None, 0), (Sword, 1), (Club, 2). [(Here is a list of possible Enumerations available to us via Script Extender)](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/blob/1b96b0824bd541933219226d48279c89635dba44/BG3Extender/GameDefinitions/Enumerations.inl)
