# Description

Lists the slots you can use when adding a Character Creation (CC) visual or in-game equippable item.

In general, it does not matter what type of item is added to a slot. E.g. you can add a pair of horns to the Horns slot, or to the Beard slot, or to the DragonbornTop (Crest) slot, and it will behave the same way each time. The main difference is which slot the user will need to click on to select it. (Caveat: if your item is colorable in CC, for example, then the user will still need to go to the relevant section to change the color.)

In many cases, the slot you should use for your mod is pretty obvious. If you're making a head, why would you want to add it to the Beard slot? However, some items don't fit neatly into the categories already provided by the game, such as wings. In those cases, it can be useful to understand all of the slots you have available to you.

There is currently no way to add new slots to the game, and doing so would probably require extensive UI editing, if it is possible at all.
