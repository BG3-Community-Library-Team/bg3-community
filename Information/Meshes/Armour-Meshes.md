# Description
## Summary
This is a collection of the wearable meshes in the game files, including some which are not utilised within the game itself. They are split between ARM (armour) and CLT (clothing). "Armour files" will be used here to refer to all ARM and CLT files.

Armour files begin with an abbreviated race name, followed by a body type (F, FS, M, or MS), followed by the type of equipment it is (ARM for armour and CLT for clothing). 
> Sometimes an item within the game will use ARM files for a piece of clothing and vice versa. On rare occasions, neither ARM nor CLT will be used.
