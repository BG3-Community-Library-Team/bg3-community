# Vertex Paint Transfer

You'll need an object with colors, and the object without colors that you want to transfer to.

You'll need to select your color mesh first and then the non color mesh, then press F3 and search Transfer Mesh Data.
Then select face corner colors.
You should now see a new color attribute on the non color mesh with the vertex colors.
