# Trajectories
This particular information is referencing spells that often contain moving parts, whether it be the character, target, or visual effects. More information on the application of Trajectories can be found [here](Link Here).

Example: `data "Trajectories" "3d34f1ca-7e7e-4ee7-ad2b-704079f4a19f"`

The GUID in the information refers to a Root Template entry, which will dictate both the path of the spell and in some cases, the visual effects as well.
