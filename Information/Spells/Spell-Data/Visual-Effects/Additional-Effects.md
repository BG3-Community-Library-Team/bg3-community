# ToggleOnEffect
This is for toggles, and the visual that will play when the ability or spell is toggled on.

# ToggleOffEffect
Same as above, except it will play this visual when the spell is toggled off, either by meeting the condition, or manually.

# ApplyEffect
This is specifically for Status Effects and passives. When a spell applies these to a target, this is the visual that will play on application.

# StatusEffect
Similar to above, this visual will continue to play as long as the target has the applied status.

# EndEffect
This is the visual that will play at the end of a statuseffect, if applicable.
