# TargetConditions
This data is intended for spells meant to have additional conditions for the target of the spell. 

Example: `data "TargetConditions" "Character() and not Dead()"`

In this case, the target must be a "Living" target, and not dead. More information on Target conditions can be found [here](/Information/Spells/Spell-Data/Target-Conditions/Additional-Info).
