## Tips
- In portrait-angled camera, you can use **FreezeShot** shader to flip the image

	<img src="/freezeshot_3.webp" alt="placeholder" width="1000">

- To avoid annoying-stacking-on-each-other shadows when you are too close to an object/character, you can disable ambient occlusion and instead use any ReShade AOs

- To avoid transparent mesh shadows, you need to increase the outer angle of your lights, either by choosing a wider angle or placing them further away. Lowering shadows quality also helps a bit, but I wouldn't recommend doing so, only in some very specific scenarios

- Default bloom has artifacts when upscaling resolution; to avoid them, use Zenteon Xenon or any ReShade blooms

## Common issues


### You is not able to read
- It is what it is, it happens sometimes. Each tool has its own wiki/documentation, you just need to google sometimes

### General
- **Screenshots have washed/gray colors:** disable HDR

### ReShade
- **Any shader that relies on depth buffer (like DoF (except IGCS DoF), AO, GI, Fog, etc) acting weird, can't be properly adjusted and so on:** make sure you set up depth buffer correctly; in **Edit global preprocessor definitions** set .**..LINEARIZATION_FAR_PLANE = 1000**, **...IS_UPISDE_DOWN = 0**, **...IS_REVERSED = 0**, **...IS_LOGARITHMIC = 0**, and in Add-ons tab check **Copy depth buffer before clear...**

- **No depth buffers found:** try launching the game in dx11 mode

### Otis_Inf photomode tool
- **No BG3 in the process list:** run the tool as admin

- **Game can't be unpaused:** change game speed in the tool using the slider

- **Camera acting weird, getting stuck and so on:** probably the game is paused

- **When hotsampling, the game is still in native resolution:** switch to **windowed** or **fullscreen**

- **If SE is console enabled, sometimes hotsampling changes console resolution. Possible solutions:** Disable the console and open it with **ctrl+f12** after launching the tool; before launching the tool, tab in to the game first and then use hotsampling

### IGCS Depth of Field
- **Image is blurry even though the focal point is correct:** switch to **classic mode** and set **1 frame to wait**, make sure you are in **windowed/fullscreen mode** and **window borders** in the tool is unchecked

- **Focal point shifts when changing resolution using hotsampling:** uncheck **window borders** in the tool

- **Purple artifacts:** disable HDR

- **The camera is moving when changing Focus delta X, but the second focus overlay is not appearing:** disable ReShade performance mode

- **Black screen when launching the game:** inject dll or disable IgcsDof.fx; if you close the game while being in the DOF session, it will get stuck

- Make sure **IgcsDof.fx** is the last in the order. (It depends, but you probably don't know what the fudge you are doing, so keep it last)
