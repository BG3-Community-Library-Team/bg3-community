## Tips
- In portrait-angled camera, you can use **FreezeShot** shader to flip the image

	<img src="/screen_archery/screenarchery_ref/screenarchery-ref-freezeshot-demo-and-settings.webp" alt="placeholder" width="1000">



- To avoid annoying-stacking-on-each-other shadows whicj can appear if you are too close to an object/character, or some where in the background, you can disable ambient occlusion and instead use any ReShade AOs

	<img src="/placeholder.webp" alt="placeholder-wip" width="1000">


- To avoid shadows which appear on transparent materials, you need to increase the outer angle of light, either by increasing outer angle or placing the light further away. Lowering shadows quality also a bit helps, but I wouldn't recommend doing so, only in some very specific scenarios

	<img src="/screen_archery/screenarchery_ref/screenarchery-ref-shadows-1-comparison.webp" alt="placeholder" width="1000">



- Default bloom has artifacts when upscaling resolution; to avoid them, use [Zenteon Xenon](https://www.zenteon.co/shaders/free-shaders/xenon) or any ReShade blooms

## Common issues


### You is not able to read
- It is what it is, it happens sometimes. Each tool has its own wiki/documentation, you just need to use google occasionally

### General
- **Screenshots have washed/gray colors:** disable HDR

### ReShade
- **Any shader that relies on depth buffer (like DoF (except IGCS DoF), AO, GI, Fog, etc) acting weird, can't be properly adjusted and so on:**
Make sure you set up depth buffer correctly: in `Edit global preprocessor definitions` set 
`RESHADE_DEPTH_LINEARIZATION_LINEARIZATION_FAR_PLANE = 1000`
`RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_IS_UPISDE_DOWN = 0`
`RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_IS_REVERSED = 0`
`RESHADE_DEPTH_INPUT_IS_LOGARITHMIC = 0`
In `Add-ons` tab check `Copy depth buffer before clear operations`

- **No depth buffers found:** try launching the game in `DX11 mode`

### Otis_Inf photomode tool
- **No BG3 in the process list:** run the tool as `admin`

- **Game can't be unpaused:** change game speed in the tool using the slider

- **Camera acting weird, getting stuck and so on:** probably the game is paused

- **When hotsampling, the game is still in native resolution:** switch to `windowed` or `fullscreen`

- **If SE is console enabled, sometimes hotsampling changes console resolution; possible solutions:**
  1. 	Disable the console and open it with `ctrl+f12` when needed
  2.  Before launching the tool, tab in to the game first and then use hotsampling

### IGCS Depth of Field
- **Image is blurry even though the focal point is correct:** switch to `classic mode` and set `1 frame to wait`, make sure you are in `windowed/fullscreen mode` and `window borders` in the tool is unchecked

- **Focal point shifts when changing resolution using hotsampling:** uncheck `window borders` in the tool

- **Purple artifacts:** disable HDR

- **The camera is moving when changing Focus delta X, but the second focus overlay is not appearing:** disable ReShade performance mode

- **Black screen when launching the game:** inject dll or disable IgcsDof.fx; if you close the game while being in the DOF session, it will get stuck

- Make sure `IgcsDof.fx` is the last in the order. (It depends, but you probably don't know what the fudge you are doing, so keep it last)
