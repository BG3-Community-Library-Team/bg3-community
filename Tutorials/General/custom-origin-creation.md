# Overview
This is a tutorial for adding a custom origin into Baldur's Gate 3. This tutorial is considered moderate difficulty--you are expected to already be familiar with code editing and searching BG3's files for the info you need.

This method is the "manual" method--it doesn't involve using the official toolkit. If someone else has a method of doing this in the toolkit, feel free to add to the page.

## So why would I want to make a custom origin?

The simplest answer is that you just play the same character a lot, and are tired of going through character creation over and over to make the exact same choices. By making a custom origin, you select your character, make changes if necessary, and boom, done.

It also helps avoid pitfalls with editing things that also edit generic Tav. For example, if one of your characters has a custom body that replaces Body Type 1, and another character who is vanilla BT1... it's not possible to have both at once, because the bodies overwrite each other. Until custom origins, where you can make your custom origin with a unique body, while still keeping the vanilla body available for regular Tav.

Of course, a custom origin *can* also have things like custom dialogue, cutscenes, and plot lines. But that's a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial. What this tutorial will create is basically just a Tav (or Durge) that's already preset with your character's options.
