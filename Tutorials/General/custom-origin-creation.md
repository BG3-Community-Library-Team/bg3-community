# Overview
This is a tutorial for adding a custom origin into Baldur's Gate 3. This tutorial is considered moderate difficulty--you are expected to already be familiar with code editing and searching BG3's files for the info you need.

This method is the "manual" method--it doesn't involve using the official toolkit. If someone else has a method of doing this in the toolkit, feel free to add to the page.
