# Overview
This is a tutorial for adding a custom origin into Baldur's Gate 3. This tutorial is considered moderate difficulty--you are expected to already be familiar with code editing and searching BG3's files for the info you need.

This method is the "manual" method--it doesn't involve using the official toolkit. If someone else has a method of doing this in the toolkit, feel free to add to the page.

## So why would I want to make a custom origin?

The simplest answer is that you just play the same character a lot, and are tired of going through character creation over and over to make the exact same choices. By making a custom origin, you select your character, make changes if necessary, and boom, done.

Of course, a custom origin *can* also have things like custom dialogue, cutscenes, and plot lines. But that's a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial. What this tutorial will create is basically just a Tav (or Durge) that's already preset with your character's options.
