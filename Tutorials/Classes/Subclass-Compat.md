# How to Add Compatible Subclass Progressions (Not Level 1):
*Guide written by EvilSnail0fDestruktion* 

Start with the Original Class level {x} progression from base game in front of you. This will not be in your mod.

1. Make a copy of the Original Class level {x} progression from base game with a new uuid and set to multiclass (it should have all base game subclasses and **no** modded ones).

2. Make another copy of Original Class level {x} progression from base game with a new uuid and your modded subclass(es) added (it should have **no** base game subclasses).

3. Make a third copy of Original Class level {x} progression from base game with a new uuid and set to multiclass and modded subclass added (it should have **no** base game subclasses).

Contine making the subclass like normal from here! :)
