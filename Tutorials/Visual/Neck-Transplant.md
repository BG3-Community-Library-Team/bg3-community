# Fixing Neck Seams
Neck seams are often due to:
- the mesh normals on the bottom of the head not matching those of the body it should go on
  - this usually looks like a line where the light seems to reflect differently on each side
- the weights on the bottom of the head not matching those of the body it should go on
  - this will appear in game (often cutscenes) where it looks like it is pulling apart slightly
- the textures on the bottom of the head not matching those of the body it should go on
  - if the above two are fine, then it may be a texture seam - more on this at the end
