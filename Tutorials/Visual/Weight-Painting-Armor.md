# Weight Painting Armor and Clothes

***[WORK IN PROGRESS]***

This tutorial is  aimed at teaching you the basics of how to weight paint armor and clothes in Blender, so that your custom-made equipment properly moves and follows character animations in the game.

## Pre-requisites
> This tutorial assumes that:
• You have Blender (3.6 and above) installed and you are minimally familiar with its interface
• You have the Blender plugin [BG3/DOS2 Collada Exporter](https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter) installed to import and export game meshes to and from Blender.
• You have [Modder's Multitool](https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/Visual/getting-started-with-3d-modding#tools-modders-multitool) or the [Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/r/installing-the-toolkit#heading-3) installed to look up and extract meshes from the game.
• **You have an armor or clothes mesh that is already fitted to your body type and race of choice**.

Now let's get started!
## Finding similar vanilla armor
The first step is to find armor or clothing in the game files that is roughly similar to your custom armor, so that we can steal the weights from it. The closest in shape to your custom armor the vanilla asset is, the better the weights will be.

Let's take this armor set for example (we will be using it for the duration of this tutorial):

Since our armor is composed of full plate armor, with a skirt and a cloak, and is fitted to Humanoid Body Type 1, we will search for similar body type 1 assets using the Toolkit's Resource Manager or Modder's Multitool.
> All armors and clothes in the game have the same naming structure, they all start with `RACE_BODYTYPE_ARM` for armor and `RACE_BODYTYPE_CLT` for clothing.

In our case, we are looking for Humanoid Feminine armors, so
