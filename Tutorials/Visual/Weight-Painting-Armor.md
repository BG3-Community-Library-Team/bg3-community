## Pre-requisites
> This tutorial assumes that:
> - You have Blender (3.6 and above) installed and you are minimally familiar with its interface
> - You have the Blender plugin [BG3/DOS2 Collada Exporter](https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter) installed to import and export game meshes to and from Blender.
> - You have [Modder's Multitool](https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/Visual/getting-started-with-3d-modding#tools-modders-multitool) or the [Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/r/installing-the-toolkit#heading-3) installed to look up and extract meshes from the game.
> - **You have an armor or clothes mesh that is already fitted to your choice of body type and race**.
