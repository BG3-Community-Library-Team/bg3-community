<p>This tutorial assumes you have some basic Blender knowledge--if you don't, we recommend following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&amp;si=GqdmSXxoU6_-RorW">Blender Guru’s Donut tutorial series</a> to get acquainted with the basics. But any tutorial that teaches you the basics of how to move around, shape the mesh, create objects, etc, should be fine.</p>
<p>Open Blender 3.6 and <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter">install the Collada/GR2 exporter plugin &nbsp;</a>if you haven't already. This will allow you to import and export .GR2s, which is the file type BG3 uses for its models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s load a hair mesh into Blender! Go to the <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Modding:Hair_Meshes">Modding:Hair Meshes</a> page and pick a mesh that you like. Take note of the Asset Name—that’s what it’s called in the game files. Open the Multitool and search the index for this Asset Name. It should have a .GR2 extension, e.g. Hair_GTY_F_GithyankiCut_Short_A_Spring.GR2. Once you find it, copy it to your project folder to make it easier to find. Then go into Blender, go to File, and Import the .GR2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://youtu.be/yQSqRF7dLB8?si=dbmIX2UpsK5XtDFR">example video of installing the plugin and importing a GR2</a>.</p>
<p>You should now see your mesh in Blender! But it looks all white… we should fix that and make it look closer to what it’s going to look like in-game.</p>
<p>To visualize the texture in Blender, follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DQ98gsKD0Rpmh7dEQRUlmLIANXP-qu5VRDlDcnfy7Q/edit">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Once finished, your hair should now display a texture in Blender.</p>
<p>If you’re not really sure what you’re looking at, BG3’s hair models are composed of pieces called “hair cards” that are essentially just long strips of mesh, or planes, with a hair texture applied. This is a (comparatively) low-poly way of making hair.</p>
<p>If you want to see how the hair looks on a head, you can import a head model into Blender too, using the exact same method you used for the hair. Just make sure the race of the <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Modding:Head_Models">Head Model</a> you choose matches the hair you’re working with—so if you’re editing HAIR_HUM_F_Afro_Long_A, choose a human or humanlike head.</p>
<p>(WIP)</p>
