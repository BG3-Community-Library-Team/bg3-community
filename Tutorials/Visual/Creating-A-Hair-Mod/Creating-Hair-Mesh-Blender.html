<p>This tutorial assumes you have some basic Blender knowledge--if you don't, we recommend following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&amp;si=GqdmSXxoU6_-RorW">Blender Guruâ€™s Donut tutorial series</a> to get acquainted with the basics. But any tutorial that teaches you the basics of how to move around, shape the mesh, create objects, etc, should be fine.</p>
<p>Open Blender 3.6 and <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter">install the Collada/GR2 exporter plugin &nbsp;</a>if you haven't already. This will allow you to import and export .GR2s, which is the file type BG3 uses for its models.&nbsp;</p>
