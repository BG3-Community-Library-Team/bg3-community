<p>So, you wanna make your own hair mod for Baldur's Gate 3? You wanna create your own mesh and then get it coded into the game as a standalone CC option?</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second--before any of that, you're gonna need some tools.</p>
<h2>Important Tools</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-6/">Blender</a> (version 3.6 recommended)<ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>

      <li>For editing code files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Choosing meshes to work with</h2>
<p>The easiest and most straightforward way of making custom BG3 hair is to take pieces of vanilla hairs and combine them into something new. So, you're gonna need to choose which vanilla hairs you'd like to use.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16cQUxQ7FrGVmIPy5929qae4cCQls4ZWuBX_w08zvv5M/edit?usp=sharing">a non-exhaustive list of hairs in the game</a>, with images and asset names/filenames included.</p>
<p>As you might suspect from the name, the <strong>filename </strong>is what the hair is actually called in the game files. You'll need this when extracting the hair meshes from the game files.</p>
