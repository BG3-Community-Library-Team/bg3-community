# Poesielibre’s Custom Wrinkle Map Guide And Template
This guide will assume you have already made and coded your head and that you are at least a little familiar with the files used in coding a custom head. This guide also assumes a custom wrinkle map has already been made and added to your mod along with the other textures.

**Just like all other maps for your custom head, make sure your wrinkle map is saved as a .DDS**
Download the template here: [PL Custom wrinkle map template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ll0D7t_e0kjSwxD8WmVL6U_Fo9Tb4Wy/view?usp=sharing)

The READ ME file provided in the template contains the same instructions as below.
The template instructions are as follow:

1.Open the zip folder, there should be a folder named ‘’YourModName’’.
This is a file path you can copy directly into your mod folder; it contains a merged.lsf.lsx file.

2.Copy the folder into your mod.

3.Open the merged file inside the provided path.

4.Follow the instructions in the file.

5.Open the merged file of your custom head and search for ‘’WrinkleMapNormal’’

6.Replace the UUID with the one you generated in the provided merged file. Save your changes and you are done!
If you need to add this wrinkle map to more than one head, simply copy that UUID to all the heads that need that map. You can use the same wrinkle map for male and female heads.
