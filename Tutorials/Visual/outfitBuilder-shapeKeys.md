# Shape Keys and Outfit Builder

**jerinski** has created a video demonstrating how to create shape keys to refit your mesh to other bodytypes using the Outfit Builder tool.

See the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AQqpOgG374)

Outfit Builder is available for download [here](https://github.com/PerplexedPeach/outfit_builder). It is also available on Nexus, but it is recommended to get the latest version from Github. 

## What is Outfit Builder?

Outfit Builder is a tool created to help refit meshes between body types. The included Blender file, `body_templates.blend`, contains the necessary shape keys to convert between vanilla body types.
