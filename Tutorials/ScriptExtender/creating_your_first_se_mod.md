# Creating your first SE Mod

This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple Mod with Norbyte's Script Extender(SE).

We will create mod that stops your companions from going back to their tent once in camp.
Aditionally we will utilize SE together with `stats` to make this toggleable.

This tutorial is based on **Alithea Ancunín's** implementation of [Please Stay] (include link here)


> If you have not used SE before, you might want to have a look at [Getting started with Script Extender](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/ScriptExtender/GettingStarted)
