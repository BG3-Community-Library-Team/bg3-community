# Getting Started

## What is Version Control?
First, let's dive into the key concept that Github, and more specifically, Git, is design to solve: Version Control. Version Control is a way of managing different versions of your code, allowing you to quickly roll back to older versions of your code when something goes wrong. It also allows you to work on multiple parts of your mod at once, without worrying about one set of features breaking things when you want to test something. In a nutshell, Version Control keeps track of every change you make, storing it in a way that allows you to go back and forth, without risking losing hours or even days of hard work if something goes wrong. There are a few different types of version control, but one of the most common ones you'll see these days, and the one used by several BG3 Modders, is Git.

Git is primarily handled via a Command Line Interface, though there are desktop and IDE GUIs for using it. This guide will walk you through using it from the Command Line - once you're comfortable with the concepts I explain here, feel free to explore these if you prefer. Install and/or prepare the tools below, and then we'll get into some of the ideas behind Git.

## Tools
- ***[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/):*** If you're modding on a Mac or Linux machine, chances are, you already have this. If you're on Windows, you'll need to install Git
- ***[A Github Account](https://github.com/):*** We'll be explaining Git through the lens of GitHub, one of the more commonly seen Git Repository sites, and the one used most often by BG3 Modders.
- ***A Text Editor:*** I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for modding, however [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and even just plain Notepad work fine.
