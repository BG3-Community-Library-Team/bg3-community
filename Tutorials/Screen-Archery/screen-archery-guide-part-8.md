## notes

Why is credit important:
- well every now and again a mod gets a feature in gaming articles and the people who write the articles will often want to use the screenshots without asking for permission or paying attention who actually took the images


Taking images for (other) mod creators:
- It is ok to turn down a modders request and only do what you're comfortable with.
- It is good practice to include a full list of mods you used. Include links to the download page if possible. If someone elses work enables you to create and share your images, the least you can do is to thank and credit them.
To compile such a list is also easier for you than the mod author or anyone else.
