# General Tips:

- The user interface (UI) is all of the information on your screen that allows you to interact with the game (mini-map, inventory, spell bar and so on). screenshots tend to look better when the UI isn't visible. **On PC, hide the UI by pressing F10.** To unhide, press F10 again. There is currently no way to hide the UI on console, but this may come with Larian's official photomode.

# Settings:
- Generally, **you want to set the game's graphic settings as high as possible for screenshots.** If your PC struggles at higher settings, you can turn up the settings when you know you want to take a screenshot and then turn them back down again when you return to gameplay.
