Fancy photo tools are helpful when taking screenshots, but they are absolutely not necessary in order to achieve great shots within the world of BG3. This section contains a range of general tips that will help you improve your shots, whether you are using external tools or just the in-game camera.

# General Tips:

- **Press F10 to hide the UI before taking a screenshot.** 
The user interface (UI), or the HUD (Head-Up Display) contains all of the information on your screen that allows you to interact with the game. In BG3, this is your mini-map, inventory, spell bar, character portraits and so on. In general, screenshots look better when the UI isn't visible. Luckily, PC players have the option to toggle the UI on and off. On PC, hide the UI by pressing F10. To unhide, press F10 again. There is currently no way to hide the UI on console, but this may come with Larian's official photomode.
- **Quicksave often and name your key saves for later use.**
Quicksaving on a regular basis will allow you to catch those locations and scenes that present excellent screenshot opportunities and easily return to them later. This is especially recommended before starting a conversation, going to camp or initiating a long rest. Similarly, if you've played through the game at least once (which you should before trying to get started in screen archery), you'll have an idea of which locations and scenes present great screenshot opportunties. Make a deliberate hard save when you reach these points and name it something that will help you remember the reason for the save.
- **Pay attention to the background of your shots.** 
I can't tell you how many times I've taken what I thought was a beautiful screenshot and later noticed a photobombing NPC or some other obstruction in the background that ruined the shot. Similarly, a thoughtful and creative background can elevate a good screenshot to a brilliant one. The foreground focus point of your shot is important, but don't forget what's behind it.
- **Take your time.**
Snapping random screenshots during a game is quick, but setting up a creative, artistic shot that tells a story can take more time than you'd expect. Taking the time to choose your characters, accessories, locations and angles will pay off in better shots.
- **Many real-world photography rules also apply to screen archery.**
Photography is a skill and an art, and there are many rules that will help improve your shots. There are a huge range of guides online that cover the basic rules of photography. We also cover some of the basics [here](/Tutorials/Screen-Archery/screen-archery-guide-part-6), specifically in relation to BG3.
- **It's okay to break the rules sometimes.**
In the immortal words of Captain Barbossa - the rules are more like 'guidelines' than actual rules. Don't be scared to experiment and try new things in your quest for a great shot. Sometimes the best shots will come from breaking a few of the rules every once in a while.
- **Consider framing and crop your images if needed.**
When you're taking your screenshot, consider how you want the final product to look. If you're taking a close-up portrait, generally you'll want it to be cropped in quite close to the subject. Other shots look best with the widest possible dimensions you can get. Take the shot with your final dimensions in mind and then crop it when you export the image from your game. You can do this with the built-in photo viewer in Windows, or using a free online tool like Canva.
- **Practice, practice, practice.** 
Like any other skill, your screen archery will improve over time if you put in the time to practice. Don't expect to get brilliant results at first - it takes time to learn what works and what doesn't. Learn from the work of others, allow yourself to fail, and take the time to critically assess your work. All of this will help you improve and develop your own unique style (more on that [here](/Tutorials/Screen-Archery/screen-archery-guide-part-6)).


# Settings:
- **Generally, you want to set the game's graphic settings as high as possible for screenshots.** 
If your PC struggles at higher settings, you can turn up the settings when you know you want to take a screenshot and then turn them back down again when you return to gameplay.
