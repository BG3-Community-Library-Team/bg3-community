<h1>Animations Import-Export</h1>
<h6>written by <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Kit">kit</a></h6>
<p>In this section of the animation tutorials we will go over importing BG3 poses/animations and exporting your poses/animations from Blender.</p>
<h2>1. Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Required software and Add-ons</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-6/">Blender</a> – recommended version is 4.5+ (3.6 is the minimum compatible version with the addon below).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter">Norbyte's BG3/DOS2 Collada Exporter</a> - An addon for Blender that allows you to import and export GR2 files for Baldur’s Gate 3 through either Collada (.DAE) or GLTF. It is always best to check for new commits and update accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib/releases">Lslib</a> – a tool by Norbyte for manipulating Baldur’s Gate 3 files. It is always best to check for new releases and update (and set a new path to your updated Divine.exe) accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14077">Animation Template with BG3 IK Animation Rigs</a> – a collection of control rigs (head and body) ready for animating.</p>
<p><strong>Within Blender</strong></p>
<p>For the addon to be able to import and export your animations straight to/from GR2 (via GLTF or Collada), <u>configure the path to Divine.exe</u> within your addon preferences. You will find Divine.exe under the Tools folder in a lslib release.</p>

<h2>2. Animations Import</h2>
<p>Find an animation/pose of your choice. For the purposes of this article, we will be using HUM_F_Rig_SCENE_CRA_PlayerFreefall_Loop.GR2 (the freefall animation during the nautiloid crash for BT1 Human).</p>
<p>GR2 animations/poses, particularly vanilla game animations, are "raw" animation transform values without any skeleton data within them. Therefore, to import them into Blender with a skeleton, <strong>you must copy a _Base skeleton</strong> (corresponding to the required body type) via LSLIB first.</p>
<p>Browse to and import your source GR2 animation, and then specify the path to HUM_F<i>_</i>Base.GR2 (since we are using BT1 here) within your unpacked files. Specify an output path (it can also be a GR2, or even the same path as the input file to overwrite it with a skeleton-containing version). <u>Leave options like “Mirror Skeletons” and “Mirror Meshes” unchecked.</u></p>
<p>Hit “Export”. Your output GR2 can then be imported into Blender with the aforementioned addon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do NOT use import via Collada for importing animations, </strong>Collada messes with the orientations of the GR2 bones/joints on import and will leave your animation unsuitable for export back into the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, your animations will import with keyframes scaled according to the FPS you had set in Output Properties in your .blend file (by default it is 24 FPS). It is best to set it to either 30 FPS or 60 FPS <strong>before import</strong>, as this is the FPS the animations usually are in the game to preserve the original keyframes.</p>
<p>After using import via GLTF:</p>
