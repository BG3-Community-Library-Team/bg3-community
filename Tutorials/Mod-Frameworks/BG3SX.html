<h2>This Guide is a work in progress</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than functions people can use to make addons for the framework, BG3SX provides a few key functionalities for other modders</p>
<h1>Whitelist</h1>
<h1>Creating an animation addon</h1>
<p>This page is very much a work in progress and will likely be updated with BG3SX 2.0.</p>
<p>This section assumes that you have .gr2 animations ready to go and converted as detailed in the custom animations guide <a href="/en/Tutorials/Animations/CustomAnimationsBlender">here</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Recommended tools</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> - a generally useful code editor for working with the folder structure and code of the mod.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ghostboats.bg3-mod-helper">BG3 Mod Helper Extension</a> - a guide for working with it <a href="https://wiki.bg3.community/Tools/bg3-mod-helper">here</a>. Useful for quickly generating uuids and handles and finding instances of them within VSCode.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool">BG3 Modder's Multitool</a> - for packing your mod.</p>
<p><a href="/animation_tutorial/samplebg3sxmod.zip">This sample mod</a> - provides all the necessary folder structure and sample files.</p>
<h2>2. Overview</h2>
<p>First, open the mod folder in VSCode (File &gt; Open Folder). You will be greeted with this folder structure:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:39.52%;"><img src="/animation_tutorial/bg3sxmodstructure.png"></figure>
<p>Firstly, assuming you have some animations, drop the gr2s into the folder under Public/(YourModFolderName)/(AnimationsFolderName). Then have a look at the lsx file under Content/Assets/etc. (again, it is recommend to unpack and have a look at the sample mod).</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:77.48%;"><img src="/animation_tutorial/animationbanklsx.png"></figure>
<p>Here you will add an entry for every animation gr2 that you have. You need to add a new uuid for the ID for every one (with the BG3 Mod Helper extension installed, simply right click to quickly generate a new uuid). The important attributes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ID: </strong>a new uuid for each animation gr2.</li>
  <li><strong>Name, SourceFile and Template: </strong>should match and the SourceFile path should be correct (make sure the capitalisation of .gr2 in the path matches the capitalisation of your actual animation file).</li>
  <li><strong>Duration: </strong>the length of your animation (must be 30 FPS) in seconds.</li>
  <li><strong>SkeletonResource: </strong>The correct armature/skeleton uuid for the body type, e.g. HUM_M<i>_</i>Base for Body Type 2, HUM_MS_Base for Body Type 4 etc.). For heads, the SkeletonResource should match the head armature you animated on.</li>
</ul>
<p>After adding entries for all of your animations, go over to <strong>AnimationSetLinks.lua</strong></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:76.82%;"><img src="/animation_tutorial/animationsetlinks.png"></figure>
<p>Here you need to generate MapKeys that are linked to each uuid you added in the AnimationBank lsx earlier. Likewise, here you can optionally add links between MapKeys for the body animations and uuids for the face animations if you have them:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:76.02%;"><img src="/animation_tutorial/faceanimslinks.png"></figure>
<p>Next, go over to <strong>SampleBG3SXMod.lua </strong>(or whatever you renamed that file to - do not forget to rename any references to it with your chosen mod name, e.g. in <strong>Config</strong> and <strong>BootstrapServer.lua</strong>). Add entries for each animation you have, with MapKeys (that were created in AnimationSetLinks.lua) for each gr2 for each body type you want to heightmatch.</p>
