<h1>A How-To tutorial about dialogue files</h1>
<p>HI!!!! Welcome to Milo Magnetuning’s guide to dialogue files! There’s a lot to cover, and venturing into these files makes you very brave indeed, but I’ll be here to guide you along the way.</p>
<p>Let’s get started, shall we?</p>
<h2><strong>SO? WHAT GOES INTO DIALOGUE IN BALDUR’S GATE 3?</strong></h2>
<p>Dialogue in the game is actually handled by a lot of files, some of which I’m still looking into, but the main ones this tutorial will focus on, and the ones you need to edit existing game dialogue are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dialog Timeline files</li>
  <li>Dialog Scene files</li>
  <li>DialogBinary files</li>
</ul>
<p>And one you likely will not need to use as much, but is still important to know about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The [PAK]_GeneratedDialogTimelines file</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is a compilation of information and resources on all the dialogue files in the game, and may need to be added to if certain things in your dialogue mod are not triggering properly.</p>
<p>I’m going to start you off by throwing you into the deep end.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT ARE DIALOGUE TIMELINE FILES?</strong></h3>
<p>Dialogue timeline files are files that control the timing of all elements required to play dialogue and cinematics, including (but not limited to) the actual voice lines, character animations, the emotions the characters use, camera angles and shot changes, and sound effects.</p>
<p>These are very lengthy and complicated files, and you will absolutely need to use a script to update the start and endtimes of anything you add to them.&nbsp; I’ll be covering mine when I get into how to work with the files in earnest!</p>
<p>First, though, I’m going to break down the elements that go into the dialogue timeline files.</p>
<h3><strong>ANATOMY OF A DIALOGUE TIMELINE FILE</strong></h3>
<p>Dialogue files are broken down into a several sections:</p>
<h4><strong>Duration:</strong></h4>
<p>The total duration of the dialogue file. Make sure you update this to account for anything you add to a dialogue file! Otherwise you may end up with something like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EuxFC8-d7parUiTvuBVPjHmkN-4LrGn/view">THIS</a>.</p>
<p>There’s not much to say about it beyond that, honestly! It’s one line, and yet I have managed to say 56 words about it anyway!</p>
<h4><strong>Phases</strong></h4>
<p>Dialogue phases are what control the actual timing of each dialogue node. A dialogue node refers to each separate line of dialogue a character might have, marked by the captions for the dialogue changing! Cinematics—the term the game uses for cutscenes and animations without voice lines—are also counted as unique dialogue nodes within the game’s files. These phases group together all elements for a single dialogue node, allowing them to play out in their proper timing when the dialogue node is called for.</p>
<p>A good way to picture the dialogue timeline files in general is to imagine them like a movie! Each bit of dialogue is contained within that movie, and you can think of phases as being specific, very brief scenes within that movie you can skip to at any time, timestamped for your convenience.</p>
<h5>These phases have four elements:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration: </strong>The total length of the dialogue or cinematic, and all elements included for them.</li>
  <li><strong>PlayCount:</strong> The number of times the dialogue will play in a row. I’ve never seen this be anything but 1, likely because it’d just be playing the same dialogue multiple times in a row, which probably isn’t ideal! Although, hm. I guess you could use it for stuff like INFINITE KISS WYLL MOD. A not hypothetical and totally actually real WIP of mine, limited by the fact you cannot actually insert “infinity” as a character into the code (and indefinite recursion is almost always a bad idea in any case). I just love him dearly ok.</li>
  <li><strong>DialogueNodeID:</strong> Linked to the TimelinePhases section found later in the file, as well as the UUID for the specific dialogue node the phase is for, which can be found in the DialogBinary files. I’ll be covering DialogBinary files later, but for now, all you need to know is that this UUID will tell the game what group of dialogue elements to play, and when.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the specific phase number associated with that dialogue node via that UUID! That same UUID will link to a MapKey and associated MapValue number, again, in the TimelinePhases section. That MapValue number is linked to the PhaseIndex for the elements in another section I’ll be covering shortly: the EffectsComponents. That listed PhaseIndex number groups together all related elements for that dialogue node! And they’re the bulk of what you’ll be editing (or cloning) for your own dialogue mods.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>QuestionHoldAutomation:</strong> I believe this is meant to trigger pauses for “question” dialogue nodes i.e. your character’s responses. I haven’t experimented with it much though! I’ve not seen any file that didn’t have QuestionHoldAutomation after every dialogue node yet, so you should probably keep that consistent in your own mods as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to note is that the Phases are in sequential order, and that order corresponds directly to the MapValue and PhaseIndex for the dialogue node! The timeline also starts counting the phases from 0 (which is how most animation/video program timelines handle things as well). Phase 0 is listed at the top of the timeline, and is also not given a PhaseIndex or MapValue number, because it’s unnecessary, being at the start of the timeline. This also means that the second listed phase will be PhaseIndex “1”, the third listed phase will be PhaseIndex “2,” and so on. You can actually mess things up by changing this order!</p>
<p>When adding things to the timeline, I recommend appending everything to the end of each necessary section. This will keep your phase order consistent, and prevent you from having to update the entire timeline at once.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind and you should be good! (And also save yourself just, a ton of work.)</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EffectsComponents: </strong>Again, this is the bulk of what you’ll be getting into and editing for your dialogue mods. I’m going to be very thorough with these, and there’s a lot to go through, so strap in!</li>
</ul>
<p>EffectsComponents contain each element needed to properly play the dialogue, and they’re played in relation to each other according to the times for each element (usually under “StartTime” and “EndTime,” but some effects only list “Time,” which is still actually when the effect is supposed to start, they just don’t have equivalent end times, and are superseded by the following listed “Time.”)</p>
<h3>So, what are the “effects components” you can choose from?</h3>
<p>So far, I’ve found the following effects components, each of which controls a different aspect of dialogue, and each of which has different set of attributes, which I’ll be going into shortly. For now, though, I’m just going to give a brief rundown of each:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TLVoice:</strong> The voice line for the character speaking.</li>
  <li><strong>TLAttitudeEvent:</strong> Controls the nodding/motion of the head and animated expressions characters are given when other animations are not being played, i.e. when a character is waiting for you to pick a dialogue choice, or is listening to the character speaking.</li>
  <li><strong>TLAnimation:</strong> Pretty self-explanatory, but this is for animations used by the characters. Mainly used for cinematics, but can be used for unique facial expression overrides as well. A note: the animations used during dialogue outside of cinematics are generally tied to the voice lines itself, and not referenced in the timeline files. This is for animations not tied to voice lines directly.</li>
  <li><strong>TLEmotionEvent:</strong> Controls the facial expressions used for the character referenced in the “Actor” section of the component.</li>
  <li><strong>TLLookAtEvent:</strong> Controls where the character is looking, as well as whether their eyes are open or closed, head and body turning, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>TLShowWeapon:</strong> Controls whether weapons and instruments are shown during the dialogue or cinematic, and when their visibility is toggled on and off.</li>
  <li><strong>TLShowPeanuts:</strong> Controls whether the characters standing behind your character during dialogue are shown or not. Like the peanut gallery!</li>
  <li><strong>TLSoundEvents:</strong> What sound effects play and when.</li>
  <li><strong>TLSwitchStageEvent:</strong> Mainly used for cinematics. Used when the characters need to change positions from their places in normal dialogue.</li>
  <li><strong>TLTransform:</strong> Mainly used for cinematics. I believe this controls changes in character position within the game world i.e. if they need to turn or walk from one place to another, but I need to do some more experimenting with it.</li>
  <li><strong>TLShot:</strong> Used to time camera position switches.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>OK, SO, I KNOW THE BASICS. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THOSE ATTRIBUTES, THOUGH?</strong></h2>
<p>Each effects component node is broken down into several attributes, as well as the times that each component and attribute will trigger and end. This section of the tutorial will contain example code blocks breaking down each effects component by their attributes, explaining what each of them means as we go. Keep in mind that not every possible attribute for these components will be present every time! Which means some possible attributes the game can process may not be listed in this tutorial yet. If you find one I missed, please let me know!</p>
<p>This section is likely going to be very long. If you’d like to find a breakdown of a specific effects component, you can hit Ctrl+F to search for the name of the component you’re looking for.</p>
<p>To start, though, I’ll be explaining some basic attributes most components have, some of which are present every time:</p>
<h4>Type:</h4>
<p>Pretty self explanatory. The type of effects component, which will be one of the kinds of components I listed above.</p>
<h4>PhaseIndex:</h4>
<p><code>&lt;attribute id="PhaseIndex" type="int64" value="1" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the PhaseIndex refers to every component necessary for a given dialogue node. All components with the same PhaseIndex number belong to the same dialogue node! For your own mods, you’ll want to make sure this number is unique, sequential, and is tied to the same MapValue number and placement in the TimelinePhases and Phases sections, respectively.</p>
<p>Also, again, the first dialogue node on the timeline will not have a PhaseIndex listed for its components. Its PhaseIndex number is actually 0, but, being at the start of the timeline, the game’s code doesn’t require it to be listed.</p>
<h4>StartTime and EndTime:</h4>
<p><code>&lt;attribute id="StartTime" type="float" value="7.42" /&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;attribute id="EndTime" type="float" value="9.21491" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>Pretty self-explanatory! The start and end time each component will play within the timeline. A few things to note, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first phase on the timeline, again, starts at 0, so it generally does not list start times for its components, unless one of those components is meant to start partway through the dialogue. It usually will list end times, though.</li>
  <li>The start and end times listed do not actually have to match the full length of the phase! You can actually add pauses at the start and end of dialogue and cinematics by adding a little extra time in the duration of the phase, and adjusting your start and end times to add the pauses where you’d like. You will want to make a note of how much time you added, though, so you can make sure the overall timeline duration matches the actual length of the phases you’ve included.</li>
  <li>These start and end times are placed within a massive timeline, and they are, again, sequential. Once again, it helps to imagine the dialogue timeline like a movie, and the phases in the timeline are little chapters you can skip to within it, with each component playing at specific times within that chapter.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Time:</h4>
<p>Some components list start and end times, and then are further broken down into “Time” elements. These are seen in components like TLEmotionEvent and TLLookAtEvent, among others. I mentioned this above,&nbsp; but to reiterate, the “Time” attribute refers to when a certain effect is supposed to start, they just don’t have equivalent end times. Instead, the next instance of the “Time” attribute will replace the previous effect listed within the component.</p>
<p>As an example, the characters’ emotions during dialogue are usually handled with the “Time” attribute. Each “Time” attribute will set the character’s expression, starting at that time. The next “Time” attribute will replace the previous expression at the listed time.</p>
<p>The StartTime, EndTime, and Time attributes are all handled <i>extremely </i>precisely, with times often being very, very tiny fractions of a second.</p>
<p>This is extremely helpful with facial expressions in particular— each character actually only has around 8 expression rigs for any given emotion, and the total number they have is actually relatively small. But by using the precise timing the game allows, it almost never feels like they’re using so few expression rigs. You can make extremely complex sequences of emotions using this method, making the characters’ expressions feel unique, despite how few rigs they actually use.</p>
<p>I’ll be getting more into the TLEmotionEvent components later! But, for now, there’s still three common elements to talk about:</p>
<h4>IsSnappedToEnd:</h4>
<p><code>&lt;attribute id="IsSnappedToEnd" type="bool" value="True" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>I believe this snaps the components to the end of the phase. This is often set to “True,” but some components are missing the attribute entirely. This is likely because the default is False, and is not necessary to list when the component doesn’t need to be snapped to the end of the phase.</p>
<h4>ID:</h4>
<p><code>&lt;attribute id="ID" type="guid" value="49292981-224c-4feb-a51b-fa7bf0fb46f3" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>The unique UUID for the specific effects component you’re looking at. It’s generally a good idea to generate a new one for each effects component you add, but the dialogue timeline files don’t seem to be able to reference UUIDs from other timeline files, so, as far as I can tell, changing these IDs is only strictly necessary when cloning effects components within the same timeline file.</p>
<p>You do also have to be careful—other UUIDs within an effects component are connected to other things, like animations, camera positions, and the characters performing the listed effects.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the last common attribute:</p>
<h4>Actor:</h4>
<p><code>&lt;node id="Actor"&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;attribute id="UUID" type="guid" value="55bce89d-670d-f7c9-6e3b-38ebe3322b32" /&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;/node&gt;</code></p>
<p>This UUID refers to which character is performing the effects component! These are usually unique to each timeline file, and will need to be updated to match when cloning effects components from other files. The component won’t be able to reference the related character if this UUID is not updated.</p>
<p>To give you an example of what I mean, the above actor UUID actually refers to Lae’zel in the timeline file for her InParty dialogue. Any time that UUID appears is related to her. So, if that UUID is listed as the actor for a voice line, that voice line will be spoken by her. If that actor is listed under a TLEmotionEffect component, then that component controls her expressions in the dialogue.</p>
<p>These UUIDs come from the TimelineSpeakers and PeanutSlotIdMap sections of the files, which I’ll be covering more later.</p>
<h2>OK, SO, WE’VE COVERED THE BASICS. WHAT ABOUT SPECIFIC EFFECTS COMPONENTS?</h2>
<p>The moment you’ve all been waiting for! Maybe. I’m now going to be breaking down each kind of effects component by its attributes. These are only example components—they won’t refer to anything specific, and almost values for the attributes have been generated new (and are almost certainly nonfunctional).</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/tutorials/tutorials/dialogue-files-tutorial/tlemotioneventvisual.png"></figure>
<p>Emotion and emotion variation ID numbers are handled in the following pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>12 possible emotions, which are given ID numbers in powers of 2.</li>
  <li>8 different .GR2 expression rigs for each of these emotions, the first five of which are closed mouth poses when the character is not speaking (this would be [Emotion]_A through [Emotion]_E), and the last three of which are open mouthed poses (this would be [Emotion]_X through [Emotion]_Y).</li>
  <li>The ID/value numbers here roughly correspond to the final letter in the file name, only with the numbers starting at 0, like other parts of the timeline file. This means that, for example, a character’s Happy_B expression rig has the ID value of "1," Happy_C has the ID value of "2," and so on. The X, Y, and Z expression rigs still follow this pattern, making the ID numbers for them 23, 24, and 25 respectively.</li>
</ul>
