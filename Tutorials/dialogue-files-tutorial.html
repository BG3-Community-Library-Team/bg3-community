<h1>A How-To tutorial about dialogue files</h1>
<p>HI!!!! Welcome to Milo Magnetuning’s guide to dialogue files! There’s a lot to cover, and venturing into these files makes you very brave indeed, but I’ll be here to guide you along the way. Let’s get started, shall we?&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SO? What goes into dialogue in Baldur’s Gate 3?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Dialogue in the game is actually handled by a lot of files, some of which I’m still looking into, but the main ones this tutorial will focus on, and the ones you need to edit existing game dialogue are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dialog Timeline files&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Dialog Scene files&nbsp;</li>
  <li>DialogBinary files&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>And one you likely will not need to use as much, but is still important to know about:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The [PAK]_GeneratedDialogTimelines file</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is a compilation of information and resources on all the dialogue files in the game, and may need to be added to if certain things in your dialogue mod are not triggering properly. I’m going to start you off by throwing you into the deep end.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE DIALOGUE TIMELINE FILES?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Dialogue timeline files are files that control the timing of all elements required to play dialogue and cinematics, including the actual voice lines, character animations, the emotions the characters use, camera angles and shot changes, and sound effects.</p>
