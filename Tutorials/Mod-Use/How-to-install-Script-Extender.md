# How to install Script Extender 

This is a guide that covers how to install Script Extender (SE for short) correctly, and from where. 
This guide will also cover well known information in the mod author communities, that many mod users may not know but should know about. 

## Why you should not download the Script Extender from Nexus: 
Do not download the SE from Nexus. This was not uploaded by Norbyte. It was uploaded by someone who had DP (Donation Points) turned on. Donation Points can be exhanged to real life money. 

The same goes for different configs such as "achivements enabler for script extender" settings on Nexus. These are native to SE and is turned on by default. 
For more information, see Norbyte's Script Extender readme: https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/blob/main/README.md

Some discord servers has taken an active stance and does not support the Script Extender on Nexus. BG3 Modding Community is one of them.

## 1: How to download Script Extender

There are two ways on how to download script extender. 

##### 1.1 First is the easy way if you are using BG3MM:

As seen above screenshot, simply open BG3MM, then go up in the bar and press on "tools" and then press "Download and extract Script Extender". 

##### 1.2 Second way is the little harder, but still easy way if you are not using BG3MM but is on linux, or using Vortex. 

First you will need to download it from Github: https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases/tag/updater-20240329

When you open the page, scroll down and press the "BG3SE-Updater" as highlighted below.

When you have downloaded the zip file from Github, you will need to navigate to your bin folder.

If you do not know how to find your bin folder, here is a small quick guide: 

Open your steam library, or if you use GOG, you will need to do the equivalent. 
When you have opened the steam library, right click on BG3 and hover over "manage", and click on "Browse local files" as highlighted below.

File explore will open your "root installation" folder. 

It should look something like this:

> For GOG users, it may look a bit different. This is okay, and normal.

Now just open the bin folder, and then you extract the "DWrite.dll" into the bin folder, that is inside the zip folder you just downloaded.
