# How to install Script Extender 

This is a guide that covers how to install Script Extender (SE for short) correctly, and from where. 
This guide will also cover well known information in the mod author communities, that many mod users may not know but should know about. 

## First a few warnings: 
Do not download the SE from Nexus. This was not uploaded by Norbyte. It was uploaded by someone who had DP (Donation Points) turned on. Donation Points can be exhanged to real life money. 
The same goes for different configs such as "achivements enabler for script extender" settings on Nexus. These are native to Script extender and comes turned on by default. For more information, look at Norbyte's Script Extender readme: https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/blob/main/README.md
