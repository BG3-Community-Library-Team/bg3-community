## How to install unique Tav

Installing unique Tav, it is recommended to not use Vortex but use BG3MM and install the data part as a loose file mod, simply because of how complex this mod is. If you use Vortex, install the pak file as normal and then follow [how to install the data main file](#how-to-install-the-data-main-file-in-unique-tav).

The first thing you need to do is go to [Unique Tav's mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754) and download both main files.
You will also need [Trips' Old Shader Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4752).

> Both main files are a requirement. 
> Likewise Trips' Old Shader Pack also a requirement. 
> Mac players will likely have an issue because of Trips' Old Shader Pack but the mod cannot function correctly without it.

#### How to install the Pak main file

When you have downloaded both Trips' Old Shader Pack and the main pak file from Unique Tav, you will need to import them into BG3MM/vortex.
If in BG3MM, remember to put the mod into the active side and "save/export order". 
If in Vortex, remember to deploy and fix the load order after. 

#### Load order in BG3MM/Vortex

Unique Tav should be relatively low on your load order, but above any patches you have.
If you are using other mods such as [Eyes of Beholder](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/315) or [Astralities' Glow Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4964) you will need to have a certain load order. The load order is found at the bottom of Unique Tav's description, however it will be posted here as well
