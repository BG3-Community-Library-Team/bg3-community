## How to install unique Tav

Installing unique Tav, it is recommended to not use Vortex but use BG3MM and install the data part as a loose file mod, simply because of how complex this mod is. If you use Vortex, install the pak file as normal and then follow [how to install the data main file](#how-to-install-the-data-main-file-in-unique-tav).

The first thing you need to do is go to [Unique Tav's mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754) and download both main files.
You will also need [Trips' Old Shader Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4752).

> Both main files are a requirement. 
> Likewise Trips' Old Shader Pack also a requirement. 
> Mac players will likely have an issue because of Trips' Old Shader Pack but the mod cannot function correctly without it.
