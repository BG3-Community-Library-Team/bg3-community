<h1>KAVT User Manual - How to Use, Customize, and Troubleshoot KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h1>
<p>This user manual covers everything there is to know about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325">Kazstra's Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup &amp; Scar Extender</a>. It covers both the primary version (KAVT) and the non-virtual port (KAVT NVP).</p>
<p>The manual was written primarily with beginners in mind, and thus is rather in-depth and detailed. However, specific sections may require users to have some baseline knowledge on how to use image editing software (such as Photoshop or Gimp). We have attempted to keep this manual as simplistic as possible, but if there are questions you have that are not covered, you struggle following the guides, or you have any kind of feedback on the content covered here or the way these guides are written or constructed, please don't hesitate to let us know <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=posts">on our mod page</a>!</p>
<p>A video guide covering basic KAVT usage will be available at some point down the line. It is being worked on by the wonderful <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/poesielibre?gameId=3474">Poesielibre</a>. :)</p>
<h2>What is KAVT?</h2>
<p>KAVT is an updated and expanded variant of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754">Unique Tav</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8912">Kaz' Virtual Tav</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three of these mods detach your Tav from the remainder of the games' characters, which by default share Tav's body meshes, textures, makeup, and tattoos, allowing your Tav to be customized further than what's possible in Vanilla BG3 without these changes also affecting NPCs or companions. Unique Tav is a very widely used mod that serves as the foundation for many BG3 customization mods. Unique Tav's author has since stepped back from modding this game and is no longer actively maintaining the mod; thus, they've provided permission for us to create this derivative that expands on Unique Tav's and Kaz' Virtual Tav's features.</p>
