<h1>KAVT User Manual - How to Use, Customize, and Troubleshoot KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h1>
<p>This user manual covers everything there is to know about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325">Kazstra's Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup &amp; Scar Extender</a>. It covers both the primary version (KAVT) and the non-virtual port (KAVT NVP).</p>
<p>The manual was written primarily with beginners in mind, and thus is rather in-depth and detailed. However, specific sections may require users to have some baseline knowledge on how to use image editing software (such as Photoshop or Gimp). We have attempted to keep this manual as simplistic as possible, but if there are questions you have that are not covered, you struggle following the guides, or you have any kind of feedback on the content covered here or the way these guides are written or constructed, please don't hesitate to let us know <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=posts">on our mod page</a>!</p>
<p>A video guide covering basic KAVT usage will be available at some point down the line. It is being worked on by the wonderful <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/poesielibre?gameId=3474">Poesielibre</a>. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is KAVT?</h2>
<p>KAVT is an updated and expanded variant of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754">Unique Tav</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8912">Kaz' Virtual Tav</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three of these mods detach your Tav from the remainder of the games' characters, which by default share Tav's body meshes, textures, makeup, and tattoos, allowing your Tav to be customized further than what's possible in Vanilla BG3 without these changes also affecting NPCs or companions. Unique Tav is a very widely used mod that serves as the foundation for many BG3 customization mods. Unique Tav's author has since stepped back from modding this game and is no longer actively maintaining the mod; thus, they've provided permission for us to create this derivative that expands on Unique Tav's and Kaz' Virtual Tav's features.</p>

<h1>General Information</h1>
<h2>Glossary - Brief Definitions of KAVT Terms</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll briefly define words you might come across within these guides that might be unfamiliar to users who don’t have experience with Unique Tav, haven’t created mods themselves, or aren’t well-versed with technology.</p>
<p><u>Atlas/Texture Atlas</u> - An atlas is a texture consisting of multiple smaller images. In the case of tattoo, makeup, and scar atlases, these smaller images are arranged in a grid pattern, and each individual image is the same size.</p>
<p><u>(KAVT) Glowmap</u> - Within KAVT, Glowmap refers to the texture containing the glow tattoo, the additional body/face tattoo, and the opacity feature, each within their own channel. In other contexts, a Glowmap is generally only used for glow (hence the name) and only features one channel, but we’ve adjusted its use within KAVT to allow for additional features.</p>
<p><u>KAVT </u>- Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The primary version of the mod using virtual textures.</p>
<p><u>KAVT NVP</u> - Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The secondary version of the mod using traditional textures.</p>
<p><u>LSLib</u> - A tool made by Norbyte used to access and manipulate BG3 game files and for mod creation. In the context of KAVT, LSLib is primarily used to pack virtual textures (and mods, if so desired).</p>
<p><u>Loose File</u> - Most commonly used in the context of “loose file replacers”. Mod files that are not loaded via mod manager but rather placed “loosely” within the game files themselves. Loose files always take priority over packed mods.</p>
<p><u>Mesh</u> - The 3D model of objects, for example the body.</p>
<p><u>Modder’s Multitool</u> - Also referred to as simply multitool. A tool made by ShinyHobo and based on LSLib, providing similar utilities to LSLib with a simpler UI. In the context of KAVT, BG3MM may be used to pack mods, such as the KAVT customization patch.</p>
<p><u>Packing</u> - This term may refer to packing a mod, which turns the file structure of a mod project into a .pak file readable by the game, or packing virtual textures, which bundles a set of three textures together.</p>
<p><u>Path</u> - The specific location of a file or folder within a computer system.</p>
<p><u>Tav</u> - The player character.</p>
<p><u>Textures</u> - A texture is a 2D image that is applied to a 3D model. In the context of KAVT, this will primarily refer to tattoo, makeup and scar atlases, body tattoos, the KAVT glowmap, and body textures.</p>
<p><u>Tile/Atlas Tile</u> - Within these guides, we may use the term “Tile” to refer to <i>one individual</i> image within a tattoo, makeup or scar atlas, meaning <i>one</i> tattoo, makeup or scar design.</p>
<p><u>Traditional Textures</u> - Within KAVT, we may use this term to refer to non-virtual textures. These are individual 2D images stored as individual files.</p>
<p><u>Virtual Textures</u> - A way of storing textures that is used to decrease file size and thus increase performance. A set of three traditional textures is bundled together and stored in this packed format instead of individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs KAVT NVP - Features &amp; Differences</h2>
<p>At their core, KAVT and KAVT NVP are <u>the same mod</u> with some internal changes to the way textures are stored. This means you’ll be using one version at a time, as they generally do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are a handful of differences when it comes to features due to the differences in how textures are stored. We won't dive too deep into the details as they aren't relevant to this guide, but in short, KAVT allows for additional face customization that isn't possible when using KAVT NVP, as swapping over to virtual textures gives us enough space within the shader to add these additional features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features Available within both KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>The following features are part of both KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP. They function identically for both mods.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unique appearance for Tav that does not affect companions or other NPCs</li>
  <li>More tattoo, scar and makeup slots with their own custom CC Icons</li>
  <li>Body tattoo (via body tattoo file also used by Unique Tav)</li>
  <li>Body glow, additional tattoo, and body opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)</li>
  <li>Traditional textures editable via loose file replacement:<ul>
      <li>Face tattoos, makeup and scars</li>
      <li>Body Tattoo (body tattoo file)</li>
      <li>Body tattoos, glow and opacity (glowmap)</li>
      <li>Head textures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Meshes editable via loose file replacement:<ul>
      <li>Bodies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features Available <u>only</u> within KAVT</h3>
<p>The following features are only available within KAVT. You cannot use these features if you are using KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual body textures (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
  <li>Virtual head wrinkle map (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
  <li>Face glow, additional tattoo, and opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)<ul>
      <li>This is a traditional texture editable via loose file replacement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Genital glow, tattoo and opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)<ul>
      <li>This is a traditional texture editable via loose file replacement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features available <u>only</u> within KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>The following features are only available within KAVT NVP. You cannot use these features if you are using KAVT.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional body textures (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Differences between KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>This is a brief summary of the differences between KAVT and KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Body Textures</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP uses traditional body textures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Head Customization</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT features a head Glowmap, allowing for head glow, an additional tattoo, and opacity to be used for customization</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not have these features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Head Wrinkle Map</u>
    <ul>
      <li>To allow for additional head customization, KAVT uses a virtual texture wrinkle map. This has little to no impact on users</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not change the format of head wrinkle maps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Genital Customization</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT features a genital Glowmap, allowing for genital glow, a tattoo, and opacity to be used for customization</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not have these features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Requirements</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT requires Script Extender</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP has no requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For users, this is primarily going to be noticeable in these ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The way body textures are replaced (different texture format)</li>
  <li>Addition or lack of additional head customization</li>
  <li>Script Extender requirement yes/no</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs Unique Tav - Comparison</h2>
<p>KAVT and KAVT NVP do everything Unique Tav does and only add to Unique Tav's features. No existing Unique Tav features are removed. The following features are added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body Glowmap, allowing additional customization</li>
  <li>Head Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)</li>
  <li>Genital Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following things are going to be the most noticeable differences between Unique Tav and KAVT or KAVT NVP for the average users.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Download &amp; Installation</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires separate loose Data files in addition to its .pak</li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP only require their .paks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Requirements</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires a separate shader mod</li>
      <li>KAVT requires Script Extender</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP has no requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Body Texture Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>These differences only apply to KAVT, not KAVT NVP</li>
      <li>Unique Tav uses traditional body textures (individual files)</li>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures (bundled sets)<ul>
          <li>This changes how body textures are replaced, but has no impact on KAVT usage if either a) using an already compatible body texture edit, or b) not customizing body textures</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Tattoo and Makeup Atlas Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP increase tattoo and makeup atlas size<ul>
          <li>This increases the number of unique designs available in CC</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Unique Tav compatible tattoo and makeup atlases need to be adjusted to the new size to work correctly<ul>
          <li>Some mod authors provide KAVT compatible versions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP use a different name for atlases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav Compatible Content</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Most Unique Tav compatible content inherently works with KAVT:<ul>
          <li>Heads</li>
          <li>Body Edits</li>
          <li>Animation Edits</li>
          <li>Tiefling Tails</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Most modded races only require a minor edit to function<ul>
          <li>Some modded races have already been updated to include this edit, making them fully compatible</li>
          <li>This edit can be made by the mod author and does not need to be made by users themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swapping may be a good option for you, if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>KAVT: You are interested in the new customization possibilities</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with additional tattoo and makeup slots</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with no requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What KAVT and KAVT NVP don't do</h2>
<p>As there has been some confusion, here is an exhaustive list of things this mod doesn’t claim to do (and also just doesn’t do):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add body tattoos to CC</li>
  <li>Add its own body tattoo designs</li>
  <li>Add any of the additional Glowmap features to CC<ul>
      <li>This includes extra face and body tattoos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allow you to select more than one CC tattoo/makeup/scar option</li>
  <li>Add any additional menus via MCM</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Compatibility and Conflicts</h2>
<p>This section provides information on which mods may or may not be compatible with KAVT and KAVT NVP. Please note that this list isn't exhaustive, meaning it doesn't cover every single mod that may or may not be compatible.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether something is compatible or not, assume things will work fine unless confirmed otherwise - just give it a try. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Unique Tav Compatible Content</h3>
<p>The majority of Unique Tav compatible content is inherently compatible with KAVT and KAVT NVP. There are some exceptions that might require some additional editing (on either the users or authors side) and they will be marked as such.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible head mods</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body mesh edits</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body texture edits</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible with KAVT NVP; no edits required</li>
      <li>Body textures will need converting into VTs unless already specifically compatible with KAVT (or its predecessor, KVT)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body tattoos</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible face tattoo and makeup atlases</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Atlases need their size and name updated unless already specifically made compatible with KAVT/KAVT NVP by the author</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible Races</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a minor edit to the races’ CharacterVisuals entries for Glowmap functionality to function correctly; other features will work as intended even without this edit</li>
      <li>This edit is best made by the author; details can be found <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/articles/1396"><u>here</u></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Miscellaneous other mods requiring Unique Tav</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Animation Edits are inherently compatible</li>
      <li>Tiefling Tails are inherently compatible</li>
      <li>Freckle and Vitiligo edits are inherently compatible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Compatible Content</h3>
<p>The majority of other mods will not cause conflicts with KAVT or KAVT NVP. To name a few mod categories that can be used alongside KAVT and KAVT NVP without causing problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Armor, clothing, weapon and other equipment mods</li>
  <li>Gameplay mods such as classes, spells and improvements</li>
  <li>CC colors such as skin, eye, and hair colors</li>
  <li>CC assets such as horns, hair styles, and accessories</li>
  <li>Dialogue and cutscene edits</li>
  <li>Utility mods, e.g. “mark books as read” or “auto use soap”</li>
  <li>ReShades</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>This mod is expansive and touches many vanilla files and entries. Because of this, there are a lot of possible points of conflict, but luckily there aren’t <i>that</i> many hard conflicts right out the gate, and most can be alleviated with patches.</p>
<p>However, the following mods are outright incompatible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mods that include edits to the same shaders we edit to achieve similar features, e.g. additional slots for makeup and tattoos:<ul>
      <li>Lemon’s Makeup &amp; Tattoo Non-Replacers</li>
      <li>Jawstarion’s variety of similar content, including<ul>
          <li>Character Creation Overhaul</li>
          <li>More Makeup and Tattoos</li>
          <li>Extra Scars for Everyone</li>
          <li>More Makeup, Tattoos and Scars</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following specific mod examples will need patches to function correctly. If the mod page already contains a Unique Tav patch, this patch is also suitable for compatibility with KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eyes of the Beholder by Labotor (Patch available)</li>
  <li>Astralities’ Glow Eyes (Patch available)</li>
</ul>
<p>‼️ Please note that when using either of these mods, you’ll need to make any edits you’d make in the KAVT customization patch <u>inside these mod’s patches instead! </u>They edit the same files and will thus override one another. You can find more information on this further down on this wiki page alongside the load order related information.</p>
