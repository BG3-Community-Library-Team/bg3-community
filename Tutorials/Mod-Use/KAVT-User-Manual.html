<h1>KAVT User Manual - How to Use, Customize, and Troubleshoot KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h1>
<p>This user manual covers everything there is to know about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325">Kazstra's Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup &amp; Scar Extender</a>. It covers both the primary version (KAVT) and the non-virtual port (KAVT NVP).</p>
<p>The manual was written primarily with beginners in mind, and thus is rather in-depth and detailed. However, specific sections may require users to have some baseline knowledge on how to use image editing software (such as Photoshop or Gimp). We have attempted to keep this manual as simplistic as possible, but if there are questions you have that are not covered, you struggle following the guides, or you have any kind of feedback on the content covered here or the way these guides are written or constructed, please don't hesitate to let us know <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=posts">on our mod page</a>!</p>
<p>A video guide covering basic KAVT usage will be available at some point down the line. It is being worked on by the wonderful <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/poesielibre?gameId=3474">Poesielibre</a>. :)</p>

<h2>What is KAVT?</h2>
<p>KAVT is an updated and expanded variant of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754">Unique Tav</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8912">Kaz' Virtual Tav</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three of these mods detach your Tav from the remainder of the games' characters, which by default share Tav's body meshes, textures, makeup, and tattoos, allowing your Tav to be customized further than what's possible in Vanilla BG3 without these changes also affecting NPCs or companions. Unique Tav is a very widely used mod that serves as the foundation for many BG3 customization mods. Unique Tav's author has since stepped back from modding this game and is no longer actively maintaining the mod; thus, they've provided permission for us to create this derivative that expands on Unique Tav's and Kaz' Virtual Tav's features.</p>

<h1>General Information</h1>
<h2>Glossary - Brief Definitions of KAVT Terms</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll briefly define words you might come across within these guides that might be unfamiliar to users who don’t have experience with Unique Tav, haven’t created mods themselves, or aren’t well-versed with technology.</p>
<p><u>Atlas/Texture Atlas</u> - An atlas is a texture consisting of multiple smaller images. In the case of tattoo, makeup, and scar atlases, these smaller images are arranged in a grid pattern, and each individual image is the same size.</p>
<p><u>(KAVT) Glowmap</u> - Within KAVT, Glowmap refers to the texture containing the glow tattoo, the additional body/face tattoo, and the opacity feature, each within their own channel. In other contexts, a Glowmap is generally only used for glow (hence the name) and only features one channel, but we’ve adjusted its use within KAVT to allow for additional features.</p>
<p><u>KAVT </u>- Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The primary version of the mod using virtual textures.</p>
<p><u>KAVT NVP</u> - Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The secondary version of the mod using traditional textures.</p>
<p><u>LSLib</u> - A tool made by Norbyte used to access and manipulate BG3 game files and for mod creation. In the context of KAVT, LSLib is primarily used to pack virtual textures (and mods, if so desired).</p>
<p><u>Loose File</u> - Most commonly used in the context of “loose file replacers”. Mod files that are not loaded via mod manager but rather placed “loosely” within the game files themselves. Loose files always take priority over packed mods.</p>
<p><u>Mesh</u> - The 3D model of objects, for example the body.</p>
<p><u>Modder’s Multitool</u> - Also referred to as simply multitool. A tool made by ShinyHobo and based on LSLib, providing similar utilities to LSLib with a simpler UI. In the context of KAVT, BG3MM may be used to pack mods, such as the KAVT customization patch.</p>
<p><u>Packing</u> - This term may refer to packing a mod, which turns the file structure of a mod project into a .pak file readable by the game, or packing virtual textures, which bundles a set of three textures together.</p>
<p><u>Path</u> - The specific location of a file or folder within a computer system.</p>
<p><u>Tav</u> - The player character.</p>
<p><u>Textures</u> - A texture is a 2D image that is applied to a 3D model. In the context of KAVT, this will primarily refer to tattoo, makeup and scar atlases, body tattoos, the KAVT glowmap, and body textures.</p>
<p><u>Tile/Atlas Tile</u> - Within these guides, we may use the term “Tile” to refer to <i>one individual</i> image within a tattoo, makeup or scar atlas, meaning <i>one</i> tattoo, makeup or scar design.</p>
<p><u>Traditional Textures</u> - Within KAVT, we may use this term to refer to non-virtual textures. These are individual 2D images stored as individual files.</p>
<p><u>Virtual Textures</u> - A way of storing textures that is used to decrease file size and thus increase performance. A set of three traditional textures is bundled together and stored in this packed format instead of individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs KAVT NVP - Features &amp; Differences</h2>
<p>At their core, KAVT and KAVT NVP are <u>the same mod</u> with some internal changes to the way textures are stored. This means you’ll be using one version at a time, as they generally do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are a handful of differences when it comes to features due to the differences in how textures are stored. We won't dive too deep into the details as they aren't relevant to this guide, but in short, KAVT allows for additional face customization that isn't possible when using KAVT NVP, as swapping over to virtual textures gives us enough space within the shader to add these additional features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features Available within both KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Differences between KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>This is a brief summary of the differences between KAVT and KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body Textures<ul>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP uses traditional body textures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Head Wrinkle Map<ul>
      <li>To allow for additional head customization, KAVT uses a virtual texture wrinkle map. This has little to no impact on users</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not change the format of head wrinkle maps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Genital Customization<ul>
      <li>KAVT features a genital Glowmap, allowing for genital glow, a tattoo, and opacity to be used for customization</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not have these features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Requirements<ul>
      <li>KAVT requires Script Extender</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP has no requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For users, this is primarily going to be noticeable in these ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The way body textures are replaced (different texture format)</li>
  <li>Addition or lack of additional head customization</li>
  <li>Script Extender requirement yes/no</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs Unique Tav - Comparison</h2>
<p>KAVT and KAVT NVP do everything Unique Tav does and only add to Unique Tav's features. No existing Unique Tav features are removed. The following features are added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body Glowmap, allowing additional customization&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Head Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)</li>
  <li>Genital Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following things are going to be the most noticeable differences between Unique Tav and KAVT or KAVT NVP for the average users.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Download &amp; Installation</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires separate loose Data files in addition to its .pak</li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP only require their .paks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Requirements</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires a separate shader mod</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Body Texture Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>These differences only apply to KAVT, not KAVT NVP</li>
      <li>Unique Tav uses traditional body textures (individual files)</li>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures (bundled sets)<ul>
          <li>This changes how body textures are replaced, but has no impact on KAVT usage if either a) using an already compatible body texture edit, or b) not customizing body textures</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Tattoo and Makeup Atlas Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP increase tattoo and makeup atlas size<ul>
          <li>This increases the number of unique designs available in CC</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Unique Tav compatible tattoo and makeup atlases need to be adjusted to the new size to work correctly<ul>
          <li>Some mod authors provide KAVT compatible versions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP use a different name for atlases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav Compatible Content</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Most Unique Tav compatible content inherently works with KAVT:<ul>

          <li>Body Edits</li>
          <li>Animation Edits</li>
          <li>Tiefling Tails</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Most modded races only require a minor edit to function<ul>
          <li>Some modded races have already been updated to include this edit, making them fully compatible</li>
          <li>This edit can be made by the mod author and does not need to be made by users themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Swapping may be a good option for you, if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>KAVT: You are interested in the new customization possibilities</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with additional tattoo and makeup slots</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with no requirements</li>
</ul>
