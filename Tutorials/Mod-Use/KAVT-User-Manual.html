<h1>KAVT User Manual - How to Use, Customize, and Troubleshoot KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h1>
<p>This user manual covers everything there is to know about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325">Kazstra's Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup &amp; Scar Extender</a>. It covers both the primary version (KAVT) and the non-virtual port (KAVT NVP).</p>
<p>The manual was written primarily with beginners in mind, and thus is rather in-depth and detailed. However, specific sections may require users to have some baseline knowledge on how to use image editing software (such as Photoshop or Gimp). We have attempted to keep this manual as simplistic as possible, but if there are questions you have that are not covered, you struggle following the guides, or you have any kind of feedback on the content covered here or the way these guides are written or constructed, please don't hesitate to let us know <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=posts">on our mod page</a>!</p>
<p>A video guide covering basic KAVT usage will be available at some point down the line. It is being worked on by the wonderful <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/poesielibre?gameId=3474">Poesielibre</a>. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is KAVT?</h2>
<p>KAVT is an updated and expanded variant of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2754">Unique Tav</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8912">Kaz' Virtual Tav</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three of these mods detach your Tav from the remainder of the games' characters, which by default share Tav's body meshes, textures, makeup, and tattoos, allowing your Tav to be customized further than what's possible in Vanilla BG3 without these changes also affecting NPCs or companions. Unique Tav is a very widely used mod that serves as the foundation for many BG3 customization mods. Unique Tav's author has since stepped back from modding this game and is no longer actively maintaining the mod; thus, they've provided permission for us to create this derivative that expands on Unique Tav's and Kaz' Virtual Tav's features.</p>

<h1>General Information</h1>
<h2>Glossary - Brief Definitions of KAVT Terms</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll briefly define words you might come across within these guides that might be unfamiliar to users who don’t have experience with Unique Tav, haven’t created mods themselves, or aren’t well-versed with technology.</p>
<p><u>Atlas/Texture Atlas</u> - An atlas is a texture consisting of multiple smaller images. In the case of tattoo, makeup, and scar atlases, these smaller images are arranged in a grid pattern, and each individual image is the same size.</p>
<p><u>(KAVT) Glowmap</u> - Within KAVT, Glowmap refers to the texture containing the glow tattoo, the additional body/face tattoo, and the opacity feature, each within their own channel. In other contexts, a Glowmap is generally only used for glow (hence the name) and only features one channel, but we’ve adjusted its use within KAVT to allow for additional features.</p>
<p><u>KAVT </u>- Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The primary version of the mod using virtual textures.</p>
<p><u>KAVT NVP</u> - Kazstra’s Virtual Tav x Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Extender. The secondary version of the mod using traditional textures.</p>
<p><u>LSLib</u> - A tool made by Norbyte used to access and manipulate BG3 game files and for mod creation. In the context of KAVT, LSLib is primarily used to pack virtual textures (and mods, if so desired).</p>
<p><u>Loose File</u> - Most commonly used in the context of “loose file replacers”. Mod files that are not loaded via mod manager but rather placed “loosely” within the game files themselves. Loose files always take priority over packed mods.</p>
<p><u>Mesh</u> - The 3D model of objects, for example the body.</p>
<p><u>Modder’s Multitool</u> - Also referred to as simply multitool. A tool made by ShinyHobo and based on LSLib, providing similar utilities to LSLib with a simpler UI. In the context of KAVT, BG3MM may be used to pack mods, such as the KAVT customization patch.</p>
<p><u>Packing</u> - This term may refer to packing a mod, which turns the file structure of a mod project into a .pak file readable by the game, or packing virtual textures, which bundles a set of three textures together.</p>
<p><u>Path</u> - The specific location of a file or folder within a computer system.</p>
<p><u>Tav</u> - The player character.</p>
<p><u>Textures</u> - A texture is a 2D image that is applied to a 3D model. In the context of KAVT, this will primarily refer to tattoo, makeup and scar atlases, body tattoos, the KAVT glowmap, and body textures.</p>
<p><u>Tile/Atlas Tile</u> - Within these guides, we may use the term “Tile” to refer to <i>one individual</i> image within a tattoo, makeup or scar atlas, meaning <i>one</i> tattoo, makeup or scar design.</p>
<p><u>Traditional Textures</u> - Within KAVT, we may use this term to refer to non-virtual textures. These are individual 2D images stored as individual files.</p>
<p><u>Virtual Textures</u> - A way of storing textures that is used to decrease file size and thus increase performance. A set of three traditional textures is bundled together and stored in this packed format instead of individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs KAVT NVP - Features &amp; Differences</h2>
<p>At their core, KAVT and KAVT NVP are <u>the same mod</u> with some internal changes to the way textures are stored. This means you’ll be using one version at a time, as they generally do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are a handful of differences when it comes to features due to the differences in how textures are stored. We won't dive too deep into the details as they aren't relevant to this guide, but in short, KAVT allows for additional face customization that isn't possible when using KAVT NVP, as swapping over to virtual textures gives us enough space within the shader to add these additional features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features Available within both KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>The following features are part of both KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP. They function identically for both mods.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unique appearance for Tav that does not affect companions or other NPCs</li>
  <li>More tattoo, scar and makeup slots with their own custom CC Icons</li>
  <li>Body tattoo (via body tattoo file also used by Unique Tav)</li>
  <li>Body glow, additional tattoo, and body opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)</li>
  <li>Traditional textures editable via loose file replacement:<ul>
      <li>Face tattoos, makeup and scars</li>
      <li>Body Tattoo (body tattoo file)</li>
      <li>Body tattoos, glow and opacity (glowmap)</li>
      <li>Head textures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Meshes editable via loose file replacement:<ul>
      <li>Bodies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features Available <u>only</u> within KAVT</h3>
<p>The following features are only available within KAVT. You cannot use these features if you are using KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual body textures (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
  <li>Virtual head wrinkle map (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
  <li>Face glow, additional tattoo, and opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)<ul>
      <li>This is a traditional texture editable via loose file replacement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Genital glow, tattoo and opacity (via KAVT Glowmap)<ul>
      <li>This is a traditional texture editable via loose file replacement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Features available <u>only</u> within KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>The following features are only available within KAVT NVP. You cannot use these features if you are using KAVT.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional body textures (editable via loose file replacement)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Differences between KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>This is a brief summary of the differences between KAVT and KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Body Textures</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP uses traditional body textures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Head Customization</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT features a head Glowmap, allowing for head glow, an additional tattoo, and opacity to be used for customization</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not have these features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Head Wrinkle Map</u>
    <ul>
      <li>To allow for additional head customization, KAVT uses a virtual texture wrinkle map. This has little to no impact on users</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not change the format of head wrinkle maps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Genital Customization</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT features a genital Glowmap, allowing for genital glow, a tattoo, and opacity to be used for customization</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP does not have these features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Requirements</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT requires Script Extender</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP has no requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For users, this is primarily going to be noticeable in these ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The way body textures are replaced (different texture format)</li>
  <li>Addition or lack of additional head customization</li>
  <li>Script Extender requirement yes/no</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT vs Unique Tav - Comparison</h2>
<p>KAVT and KAVT NVP do everything Unique Tav does and only add to Unique Tav's features. No existing Unique Tav features are removed. The following features are added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body Glowmap, allowing additional customization</li>
  <li>Head Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)</li>
  <li>Genital Glowmap, allowing additional customization (KAVT only)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following things are going to be the most noticeable differences between Unique Tav and KAVT or KAVT NVP for the average users.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Download &amp; Installation</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires separate loose Data files in addition to its .pak</li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP only require their .paks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Requirements</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Unique Tav requires a separate shader mod</li>
      <li>KAVT requires Script Extender</li>
      <li>KAVT NVP has no requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Body Texture Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>These differences only apply to KAVT, not KAVT NVP</li>
      <li>Unique Tav uses traditional body textures (individual files)</li>
      <li>KAVT uses virtual body textures (bundled sets)<ul>
          <li>This changes how body textures are replaced, but has no impact on KAVT usage if either a) using an already compatible body texture edit, or b) not customizing body textures</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Tattoo and Makeup Atlas Differences</u>
    <ul>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP increase tattoo and makeup atlas size<ul>
          <li>This increases the number of unique designs available in CC</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Unique Tav compatible tattoo and makeup atlases need to be adjusted to the new size to work correctly<ul>
          <li>Some mod authors provide KAVT compatible versions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>KAVT &amp; KAVT NVP use a different name for atlases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav Compatible Content</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Most Unique Tav compatible content inherently works with KAVT:<ul>
          <li>Heads</li>
          <li>Body Edits</li>
          <li>Animation Edits</li>
          <li>Tiefling Tails</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Most modded races only require a minor edit to function<ul>
          <li>Some modded races have already been updated to include this edit, making them fully compatible</li>
          <li>This edit can be made by the mod author and does not need to be made by users themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swapping may be a good option for you, if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>KAVT: You are interested in the new customization possibilities</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with additional tattoo and makeup slots</li>
  <li>KAVT NVP: You want Unique Tav with no requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What KAVT and KAVT NVP don't do</h2>
<p>As there has been some confusion, here is an exhaustive list of things this mod doesn’t claim to do (and also just doesn’t do):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add body tattoos to CC</li>
  <li>Add its own body tattoo designs</li>
  <li>Add any of the additional Glowmap features to CC<ul>
      <li>This includes extra face and body tattoos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allow you to select more than one CC tattoo/makeup/scar option</li>
  <li>Add any additional menus via MCM</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Compatibility and Conflicts</h2>
<p>This section provides information on which mods may or may not be compatible with KAVT and KAVT NVP. Please note that this list isn't exhaustive, meaning it doesn't cover every single mod that may or may not be compatible.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether something is compatible or not, assume things will work fine unless confirmed otherwise - just give it a try. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Unique Tav Compatible Content</h3>
<p>The majority of Unique Tav compatible content is inherently compatible with KAVT and KAVT NVP. There are some exceptions that might require some additional editing (on either the users or authors side) and they will be marked as such.</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible head mods</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body mesh edits</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body texture edits</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible with KAVT NVP; no edits required</li>
      <li>Body textures will need converting into VTs unless already specifically compatible with KAVT (or its predecessor, KVT)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible body tattoos</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Innately compatible; no edits required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible face tattoo and makeup atlases</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Atlases need their size and name updated unless already specifically made compatible with KAVT/KAVT NVP by the author</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Unique Tav-compatible Races</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a minor edit to the races’ CharacterVisuals entries for Glowmap functionality to function correctly; other features will work as intended even without this edit</li>
      <li>This edit is best made by the author; details can be found <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/articles/1396"><u>here</u></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Miscellaneous other mods requiring Unique Tav</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Animation Edits are inherently compatible</li>
      <li>Tiefling Tails are inherently compatible</li>
      <li>Freckle and Vitiligo edits are inherently compatible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Compatible Content</h3>
<p>The majority of other mods will not cause conflicts with KAVT or KAVT NVP. To name a few mod categories that can be used alongside KAVT and KAVT NVP without causing problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Armor, clothing, weapon and other equipment mods</li>
  <li>Gameplay mods such as classes, spells and improvements</li>
  <li>CC colors such as skin, eye, and hair colors</li>
  <li>CC assets such as horns, hair styles, and accessories</li>
  <li>Dialogue and cutscene edits</li>
  <li>Utility mods, e.g. “mark books as read” or “auto use soap”</li>
  <li>ReShades</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>This mod is expansive and touches many vanilla files and entries. Because of this, there are a lot of possible points of conflict, but luckily there aren’t <i>that</i> many hard conflicts right out the gate, and most can be alleviated with patches.</p>
<p>However, the following mods are outright incompatible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mods that include edits to the same shaders we edit to achieve similar features, e.g. additional slots for makeup and tattoos:<ul>
      <li>Lemon’s Makeup &amp; Tattoo Non-Replacers</li>
      <li>Jawstarion’s variety of similar content, including<ul>
          <li>Character Creation Overhaul</li>
          <li>More Makeup and Tattoos</li>
          <li>Extra Scars for Everyone</li>
          <li>More Makeup, Tattoos and Scars</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following specific mod examples will need patches to function correctly. If the mod page already contains a Unique Tav patch, this patch is also suitable for compatibility with KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eyes of the Beholder by Labotor (Patch available)</li>
  <li>Astralities’ Glow Eyes (Patch available)</li>
</ul>
<p>‼️ Please note that when using either of these mods, you’ll need to make any edits you’d make in the KAVT customization patch <u>inside these mod’s patches instead! </u>They edit the same files and will thus override one another. You can find more information on this further down on this wiki page alongside the load order related information.</p>
<h1>Baseline Usage</h1>
<h2>QuickStart Guide - Plug &amp; Play Installation</h2>
<p>This section of the guide only applies if you’ve either <i>never </i>used Unique Tav before, or are installing KAVT or KAVT NVP on a clean game installation that<i> does not contain</i> Unique Tav. For information on how to transfer from Unique Tav to KAVT or KAVT NVP, please see the section providing information specifically about transferring from Unique Tav to KAVT or KAVT NVP instead.</p>
<p>This guide also does not contain information on how to customize KAVT or KAVT NVP. It only covers basic, plug and play style installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to quickly get started with KAVT or KAVT NVP</h3>
<p>Download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files">the mod page</a>, and install it using your mod manager of choice (we recommend the <a href="https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager">BG3 Mod Manager</a> by LaughingLeader).</p>
<p>You’ll want to position KAVT or KAVT NVP relatively close to the bottom of your load order. If you want more detailed instructions on load order in general, we’d recommend checking out <a href="https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/general-load-order"><u>this</u></a> guide.</p>
<p>The only things you should be loading below KAVT or KAVT NVP and it’s associated patches (e.g. Eyes of the Beholder or Glow Eyes Unique Tav patches) are the following types of mods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compatibility Framework mods</li>
  <li>Major patches, e.g. Padme’s patches</li>
  <li>Compatibility Framework itself</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, within my personal load order containing 204 mods, KAVT is located at load order spot number 197.</p>
<p>For basic installation, either as the baseline for customization or in order to solely benefit from the additional tattoo, makeup and scar slots, this is it. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Swapping from Unique Tav to KAVT or KAVT NVP</h2>
<p>Both KAVT and KAVT NVP are set up to <u>replace</u> the Unique Tav pak within your mod folder. This means that importing the KAVT or KAVT NVP .pak file via the BG3 Mod Manager (or alternatively manually placing the .pak in your mod folder) will <u>overwrite</u> the Unique Tav .pak file automatically.</p>
<p>However, <u>KAVT will not remove the Unique Tav Data files within your game files</u>. Those files will remain unless you manually remove them, but keeping them in place will <u>not</u> cause problems.</p>
<p>This guide will assume you are installing mods via the BG3 Mod Manager by LaughingLeader. The process would be similar when using the in-game mod manager instead, but not exactly the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Swapping the .pak File</h3>
<p>Download the .pak file of your choosing from the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files">KAVT mod page</a>. You will be using either KAVT or KAVT NVP - you cannot use both at the same time as they do the same thing.</p>
<p>Next, import the .pak file into your Mod Manager as you usually would. You can do this by either dragging the .zip file you downloaded into the Mod Manager window, or by unzipping the file and placing the .pak file inside within your mod folder manually. Your mod folder is located at the following path by default:</p>
<p><code>C:\Users\(YOURNAME)\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur’s Gate 3\Mods</code></p>
<p>The KAVT or KAVT NVP .pak file will override the Unique Tav .pak file, as they share the same name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adjusting your Tattoo and Makeup Atlases</h3>
<p>This section applies to both KAVT and KAVT NVP. You will <u>only</u> need to do this if you have installed loose file tattoo or makeup atlases when using Unique Tav and would like to continue using them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If you want to use KAVT or KAVT NVPs included options instead</h4>
<p>If you aren’t looking to continue using your custom tattoo and/or makeup atlas and would like to use KAVT or KAVT NVPs included options instead, you theoretically do not need to make any changes.</p>
<p>KAVT and KAVT NVP use different file names for tattoo and makeup atlases than Unique Tav does. This means that by default, the mod will not read your Unique Tav atlases and instead use the atlases inside the KAVT or KAVT NVP .pak instead. However, if you want to keep your Generated folder tidy, we would recommend deleting the atlases currently in place (remember to back them up if they're custom and not available to download anywhere else!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If you want to use a custom Tattoo or Makeup atlas</h4>
<p>If you would like to use the custom atlases you already used with Unique Tav, you will need to make two types of changes to your atlases for them to work alongside KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: Some creators have made KAVT compatible versions of their tattoo and makeup mods available. If the modded options you use have been made compatible already, you can download those versions instead and won’t need to make any changes yourself.</p>
<p><u>Re-Sizing your Atlases</u></p>
<p>For this step, we recommend using the “Tattoo, Makeup and Scar Atlas” resource available under “Optional Files” in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files"><u>the file tab</u></a> on KAVTs mod page.</p>
<p>To briefly explain why we recommend this - .DDS files are compressed, similarly to a .jpeg. Opening a .DDS file, making edits, and then saving it once more will degrade the quality of the image, similarly to how .jpeg files may appear “crunchy” - Lines will be less crisp and designs may become blurry or artifacted. The resource we’ve made available is in the form of a .psd file, which is not compressed. This will ensure things aren’t compressed multiple times, keeping your tattoos and makeup as crisp as possible.</p>
<p>The process is the same for both the tattoo and makeup atlas. You will need Photoshop or Gimp to do this. For this guide, we will be using the files “KAVT Tattoo Atlas - Merged” and/or “KAVT Makeup Atlas - Merged”. We will only cover adding your existing Unique Tav atlas to the bottom half of the larger KAVT atlas - if you want to modify where specific designs are located or assemble a fully custom atlas, we recommend checking out the more in-depth guide included in the Resources file that goes over working with the “Working File” instead. :)</p>
<p>When opening the file, you’ll see the larger tattoo or makeup atlas on the screen. You will also want to open the atlas you have used alongside Unique Tav at the same time.</p>
<p>Inside your Unique Tav atlas file, open the “Channels” tab. Within Photoshop, this tab is located next to the “Layers” tab - this’ll be similar with other image editing software.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:451px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfT1bZybgRMYyaLiNZOTeIFMCzZoTsCzO_yv0J4SXzibgIwIj_TBLOow4HLEJ6Ceol9t6wBNbGvlcJ-PtOVLslwPhCAoJbC9EOPZMhEAXXebHMWYtwYh0HD3AOkjEmulpv46ft-LQ?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA">
  <figcaption>Channels Tab in Photoshop</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Select the “Red” channel from the list. The appearance of your image will change, and only the red tattoos will be visible. Select the entirety of your canvas using the selection tool, and copy it (ctrl+c, or navigating to Edit &gt; Copy in the top bar).</p>
<p>Now, swap over to your KAVT atlas.</p>
<p>Similarly, navigate to the “Channels” tab and select the red channel. Paste (ctrl+v, or navigating to Edit &gt; Paste in the top bar) the “Red” channel you just copied from your Unique Tav atlas into the “Red” channel of your KAVT atlas. Re-position it by dragging it downwards until it covers the bottom half of the atlas.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll repeat this same process for the “Green” and “Blue” channels of your atlases. Once you’ve done this for all three channels, you’ve successfully added your Unique Tav atlas to the bottom half of the KAVT atlas.</p>
<p>Next, we will save our atlas. Navigate to File &gt; Save As, then choose the location for your file. You can either save it directly to the correct location, or save it to a different location and then copy it over to the correct path:</p>
<p><code>YOURGAMEFOLDER\Generated\Public\Shared\Assets\unique_tav\FACE</code></p>
<p>You will want to choose the following names for your atlases:</p>
<p><u>Tattoo</u>: KVT_Head_Atlas_Tattoo.DDS</p>
<p><u>Makeup</u>: KVT_Head_Atlas_Makeup.DDS</p>
<p>Capitalization and spelling are important here! Your game will not read these files correctly if there are spelling mistakes, capitalization differences, or the file is placed at the wrong location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the export settings we will use to save our atlases:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:440px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdk8VwKmTxEXFWolcWFhktPvzm4G0Rs1_KmsIsvc8dsGoQEPKmSwOLj9DbbpzTtEpu7MlCtvFH-3ANKjwanCFrlDW86n7_V-KMr0YNPORPrMC550Qrx-oHmxQ3VS84hZcXnE_nzEQ?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA">
  <figcaption>Tattoo and Makeup Atlas Export Settings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Please note your menu might look slightly differently if you use the NVIDIA dds plugin for Photoshop instead of the Intel one, or you are using another image editor to make these changes.</p>
<p>Now, your atlas has been re-sized and re-named and will work with KAVT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Why do we need to re-size the atlas?</u></p>
<p>The changes allowing for the larger atlas to work are made within the shader we edit within KAVT. Inside the shader, we have told the game to look for an atlas that is 4 tiles wide and 8 tiles tall - the game will <i>always</i> treat the atlas as if it is that size, even if the atlas you’ve added is only 4 tiles tall.</p>
<p>This image illustrates what issues that might cause:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXer4S5ZqWyJeylRRLB-yGe_39220aPpPfpsTGezZCkqVxtaIGRrTVQuuYjLdKmmHHAC10uSxFBLtbXCP3dyZHKi_jdwDq2o_UvCAwWpcWVq-qhDmUmKGrJCn5FK9d7V5e-z92Je?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA">
  <figcaption>Atlas Size Mismatch</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, the left atlas contains one tattoo neatly within each tile. The atlas on the right, however, is cut up into more sections than there actually are tattoos, resulting in each tattoo getting cut in half. In-game, this results in misplaced and awkwardly cut tattoos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why you’ll want to re-size your atlas. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Swapping Unique Tav Body Mesh Edits</h3>
<p>If you’ve installed body mesh edits as loose files within your game files, you won’t need to make any changes for these body meshes to also with with KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Swapping the Unique Tav Body Tattoo</h3>
<p>If you’ve used a body tattoo with Unique Tav by placing the body tattoo file as a loose file within your game files, you will not need to make any changes for this body tattoo to also work with KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Swapping Unique Tav Body Texture Edits</h3>
<p>If changes are necessary depends on whether you are using KAVT or KAVT NVP.</p>
<p>You only need to do this if you are using custom body textures! This is not a requirement for body tattoos, or head tattoo or makeup atlases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If you are using KAVT NVP</h4>
<p>If you’ve used custom body textures with Unique Tav by placing your replacement body textures as loose files within your game files, you will not need to make any changes for these body textures to also work with KAVT NVP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>If you are using KAVT</h4>
<p>Because KAVT uses virtual textures instead of traditional ones, you’ll need to convert your body textures to virtual textures to continue using them. We have tried to make this process as simple as possible for users, but if you struggle doing this, please feel free to reach out!</p>
<p>‼️Note: Some creators have made KAVT compatible versions of their body texture mods available. If the modded options you use have been made compatible already, you can download those versions instead and won’t need to make any changes yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Setting Up to convert Body Textures</u></p>
<p>For this step, we recommend using the “Virtual Texture Workspace” resource available under “Optional Files” in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files"><u>the file tab</u></a> on KAVTs mod page.</p>
<p><u>Requirements</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Norbyte’s <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib/releases">LSLib</a></li>
  <li>The KAVT Virtual Texture Workspace available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files">in the Files tab on the mod page</a></li>
  <li>Your body textures of choice, including CLEA, NM, and HMVY</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you’ll need to use LSLib to pack Virtual Textures. You cannot do so with the Modder’s Multitool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 1 - Acquiring LSLib</u></p>
<p>If you haven’t used LSLib before, acquire it from the link above. All you’ll need to do to set up this tool is download it from the link available above and unzip the files in the location of your choice. Make sure you have .NET 8.0 installed, as it is required for this tool to function - You can find the download link on LSLib’s release page linked above.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc7zhPjuPRFRAvF0jN9w8rNL09NisjdV4IZhsGfcAh6OMT9s7lb9AU1cI8-G7MyHnMr1yln_D2Zw5iDS2qYs_VX0YgKjTI1ytJvONnK6eTc5dIZIWo4dDwlJHDonYRdyNxndASp?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 2 - KAVT Virtual Texture Workspace</u></p>
<p>Download the KAVT Virtual Texture Workspace from the optional files in the File tab on this Mod page. Using this workspace will make this process significantly easier as all configuration files required for packing Virtual Textures using LSLib have already been created for you.</p>
<p>Similarly to LSLib, you’ll want to unzip the folder inside this .zip wherever you’d like it to be - Ideally somewhere you’ll find it easily, as we will be using the files within throughout this process. There is no setup required for any of the configuration files within the workspace, they’ll function as is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 3 - Inserting your Textures</u></p>
<p>Next, we’ll be adding our new Body Textures to the workspace. For this guide, I’ll be using the feminine Githyanki textures as an example - the process will be the same for every Race and Bodytype, only the exact names of the files used in the process will change according to which Race and Bodytype you’re looking to edit.</p>
<p>You’ll place your body textures within the following folder of the workspace: …\unique_tav\Conversion\Textures\(TEXTURES GO HERE). When you open this path, you’ll find it’s already filled with textures. These are the vanilla versions of all Body Textures, and whichever ones you’re not interested in changing can simply remain - we will not be touching them.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd4trx2KGTsDUrFv-WpIEnIUha3owwWrHoNjp9t3GLZpZ80zYEMIaKptYd3lYUd4fCkLE-7bwoL1Aeli-ml0I_kzwQ9aUX7tf02DWMKNXrAFcv_554OKwzJ7KgSdsGSJiD23o631A?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>Take note of the naming convention of the textures in this folder. You’ll need to match these names when adding your textures to this folder. These textures follow the following naming convention, with content not in brackets being consistent between all races and body types:</p>
<p><code>UNIQUE_(RACE)_(M/F)_NKD_BODY_A_(TEXTURE TYPE).DDS</code></p>
<p>For the sake of our example, we will be adding our textures to this folder after re-naming them as follows:</p>
<p>UNIQUE_GTY_F_NKD_Body_A_CLEA.DDS</p>
<p>UNIQUE_GTY_F_NKD_Body_A_NM.DDS</p>
<p>UNIQUE_GTY_F_NKD_Body_A_HMVY.DDS</p>
<p>If you’re asked if you’d like to overwrite these files, select yes. Do not delete any of the other textures in this folder, even if you aren’t using them. Please keep in mind that for Virtual Textures, all three of these textures will need to use BC3/DXT5 compression. This is a distinct difference between Virtual Textures and Traditional ones, as for Traditional Textures, all three textures require different compression types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 4 - Using LSLib</u></p>
<p>Now that our texture edits are in place, we’ll be packing our Virtual Textures using LSLib. Launch the tool and navigate to the “Virtual Textures” tab towards the top of the UI. You’ll be working within the “Build Tile Set” section of this tab.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeeERhmgWwFJsxMaXIFxm-n0_G4f_lAsa2Ng2G8OolBWxnkGYxNTi-X9me8kYkWAohshLTQcuZDU42izgmdjYA9_mVMTgqNE9lp9BJYwwRrcrByINENPJBGycYKaAl10erCSU9W?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>Click the three dots on the right of the “Tile Set Configuration” line. In the window that opens, navigate to wherever you unzipped your KAVT Virtual Texture Workspace and further to unique_tav\Configs. Within this folder, select whichever Config file matches the Race and Body type combination your body textures are intended for. In our case, this is the Config file named “VTexConfigGTYF” - VTex Config Githyanki Female. Double click this file, which will add it’s path to the Tile Set Configuration field.</p>
<p>This is our configuration file. It dictates which textures will be packed into which .gtp/.gts file; the files that will store our Virtual Textures moving forward.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFn066KWtirwihfIEtKKr28rJOhsSfW8_jHrlfYTCFfadmVuZxVaFDsoERK6sdgHrLq3bvr-mp5MAHRj5KFlEOH2VPwfi_f3AwdzxMduk_gj-rbuxHm_dZn_OC-MjhYP8v-vBYPw?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>Next, click the three dots on the right of the “Mod Root Path” line. Navigate to where you’ve unzipped your KAVT Virtual Texture Workspace once again, and select the folder named “unique_tav” that contains “Configs”, “Conversions”, and “Public”. Once again, click open, or simply double-click the file.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe9s8CZvoZTe5Gt4u3xlNAVG2G-fhJ68gWceHG5FX8k7rV4ztM5epb04OvQY55i3cYsXP3CDHUIOqwYlCYv-2S6V_FskCBLqKu0wUCqOUrsaL2EEynY9BLoZkTMn9qPWk2SqYIW9Q?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>Now, simply click “Build”. LSLib will now build your Virtual Texture tilesets. You’ll receive a small popup once the process has finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 5 - Loading your .gts and .gtp files</u></p>
<p>Now that we’ve successfully packed our Virtual Textures, we can add them to our game files. Similarly to how Body Texture overrides function for Unique Tav, KAVT’s Virtual Textures are loaded as loose file overrides.</p>
<p>First, we’ll grab our freshly generated set of Virtual Texture files from within our workspace. They’re located at …\unique_tav\Public\unique_tav\Assets\VirtualTextures\(TEXTURES ARE HERE). You’ll want to copy both the .gtp and the .gts for your corresponding Race and Body Type.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc_agdyNTl9AnTVpW9V56ERpcJqYRzq_QQQBTe8kFX4VX3swEoQupxL0TgMIIsnGyh-82tmqwjnyIiPhWUvnVpb4-HSBHpTOjUDlzbOY_E-XyE78dsp9ZNtwnOkj5sGTBC8cI77Lw?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>Next, navigate to your game’s Data folder - the easiest way to do so is via the BG3 Mod Manager’s shortcut, if you’re using it as your Mod Manager. Alternative, you can directly navigate to it; it’ll be located at …\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further navigate to …\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data\Public\unique_tav\Assets\VirtualTextures. Paste the .gts and .gtp files you copied from within your workspace into this folder. This is where your Virtual Texture overrides will be located.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdM8IA6qXPLpdF7SH_0pUDLdCzi3HZQi8AfCKxUM4Urm0oQG6Yov-0kDSn9Q3vZwnfLVCNL_GjXA4Wqv1ZuSBTcVZ1je94q3xBTkZhiY-fcEdaBlPMTqzkeOTPGlAt1O3kV7Tll?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 6 - Test your body textures in-game</u></p>
<p>Finally, you’ll now be able to load up your game and witness your body textures in all their glory!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>KAVT-Specific Load Order Information</h2>
<p>This section will specifically talk about load order in the context of KAVT and KAVT NVP and will mostly cover things like Unique Tav/KAVT patches, races, Glow Eyes/Eyes of the Beholder, and similar things.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in more generalized load order information, we’d recommend checking out <a href="https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/general-load-order"><u>this</u></a> guide instead. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>KAVT and KAVT NVP, as well as modded races and Glow Eyes/Eyes of the Beholder, can be somewhat sensitive when it comes to load order because they all edit the same entries.</p>
<p>These entries are “Character Visuals” entries. They define your character’s baseline appearance in CC, and there is one entry for each race and body type combination (meaning four entries per subrace). Unfortunately, we cannot make multiple changes to these same entries without overwriting each other - this is why patches are necessary, and load order is important, as whichever mod modifies these entries last will overwrite all other changes to these entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Order to Load Things in</h3>
<p>Generally, this is the order we’d recommend loading things in. Please note these do not need to be <i>directly</i> after one another. We are also only covering content that directly relates to KAVT in some capacity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Race Mods</li>
  <li>Race Mods’ Unique Tav Patches</li>
  <li>Head Mods</li>
  <li>Head Mods’ Unique Tav Patches</li>
  <li>KAVT or KAVT NVP</li>
  <li>KAVT Customization Patch*</li>
  <li>Glow Eyes or Eyes of the Beholder</li>
  <li>Glow Eyes or Eyes of the Beholder Unique Tav Patch</li>
</ul>
<p>*Please note that this patch will not work if you are using Glow Eyes or Eyes of the Beholder. As mentioned above, these mods all edit the same entries and will overwrite each other! In practice, this means EotB/Glow Eyes are overwriting your customizations - make those changes in EotB/Glow Eyes patches instead!</p>
<p>In practice, this may look something like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:396px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc53L-YS9Dw5_wy9cbbkJtbmoj-PEb2ox9pFE7G4ZACRwOjBZtRA-SFch_JbMMZXuiT3-IwWyHdMwtvKkfZMli0Lm_7e7dUqgEUni1kSY-J1Wmmr0Ffy4kuSxOjStppFWcH2egqXQ?key=1YfCsAq9MlCYJYChLgQ6UA"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Customization</h1>
<h2>The KAVT Glowmap</h2>
<p>If you've previously used <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8912">Kaz Virtual Tav</a>, you may already be familiar with the concept of the glowmap. To briefly summarize, a glowmap is a type of texture that traditionally adds glow in some capacity - in the context of KVT, the glowmap allows you to add a glowing tattoo to your Tav. For KAVT and KAVT NVP, we've made some adjustments to the glowmap to make additional features possible, utilizing the additional two, previously empty channels of the texture to allow for an additional tattoo, and opacity.</p>
<p>The name glowmap was kept the same despite these additions, as the name had to remain this way internally to ensure compatibility with content that previously utilized the glowmap functionality of KVT. While it technically no longer is solely a glowmap, it is still called a glowmap in this context to avoid confusion and mismatch between internal names and what users see. :)</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:402px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPhDdhMfBlzncTw5Lgp-1cjHk1IeC7fS4y1NeWks2dfaVjx8CRAvIVRypVfIE-INdlS8q9TAsmnoOkyo56N8gcLM6C9Gl6n0owYIshaQMBSAJToNWhxjtAWctBs0RODNtCb7fJHQ?key=j4J4jVdHF6eMIcKFfNctTg">
  <figcaption>Example KAVT Head Glowmap</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, the glowmap appears similarly to the tattoo and makeup atlases - one design appears in red (this is the glowing tattoo, located on the red channel), and one design appears in blue (this is the additional tattoo, located on the blue channel). Each glowmap contains a single design on each channel, compared to an atlas, which consists of multiple designs per image arranged in a grid pattern. This means that to change the design added via glowmap, you'll only need to replace the texture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Customizing the Glowmap</h3>
<p>We recommend utilizing the KAVT Glowmap Resource available among the optional files on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16325?tab=files">KAVT mod page</a>. Using this resource will make the process of creating the glowmap easier, particularly for users who have not made one before.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: Some creators have made KAVT compatible mods utilizing the glowmap. If the modded options you use have been made compatible already, you can download those versions instead and won’t need to create a glowmap yourself.</p>
<p>The Glowmap Resource contains the following files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Example .psd files of all 3 Glowmaps, merged<ul>
      <li>Provided to provide an example of what a finished Glowmap may look like</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>.psd files of all 3 Glowmaps, working files<ul>
      <li>Provided to simplify the creation of content compatible with KAVT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A PDF guide</li>
</ul>
<p>The glowmap resource is a little more bare-bones than e.g. the atlas resources. This is because the glowmap is very customizable, and doesn't contain any design by default. The examples provided contain two designs on two channels of the glowmap texture.</p>
<p>If you have little experience editing images with Photoshop or GIMP, we'd recommend checking out the BG3 Image Editing Basic section further down on this wiki page first. It covers some of the baseline skills you might need to do this sort of editing - all of these skills are very simple to acquire, and editing these resources isn't as scary as it might seem if you haven't done so before! The Image Editing Basic section primarily covers very basic information on how to use image editing software for users who have never interacted with software like this before, meaning that if you have used Photoshop or Gimp in any capacity, you're likely good to go when it comes to editing the glowmap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>General Information</u></h4>
<p>All three Glowmaps (for the head, the body, and the genitals) are set up to function the same way - there are no differences regarding the functions of each channel between the three types of glowmaps included in KAVT.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: KAVT NVP users only have access to the body glowmap due to restrictions imposed by the shaders themselves.</p>
<p>As a Mod user, you’ll primarily be utilizing the <u>Red</u> and <u>Blue</u> channels of these textures. The Green channel contains the Opacity feature, which is currently in an experimental state and will likely primarily prove useful to Mod Authors.</p>
<p>The <u>Red channel contains the Glow</u>, which appears as a glowing, pulsing Tattoo in-game. The <u>Blue channel contains the Additional Tattoo</u>. The Glowmap only contains their designs, and colors are customized either by file edit, or in CC (by eye color).</p>
<p>All three Glowmaps are provided at a size of 4096px x 4096px. You may scale them down without their features being negatively affected. This may be beneficial especially in the case of the Head Glowmap, as if you decide to use, for example, existing Tattoo or Makeup designs that are originally part of an atlas for this Glowmap, they may be smaller than the size of the glowmap resource provided. However, designs may be less crisp if you decide to scale them down. This will be particularly noticeable on the body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>Editing the Head Glowmap</u></h4>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: The head glowmap is only available within KAVT.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: We have used Photoshop to edit the Glowmap; the process will be very similar when working with Gimp instead, but what you see within your image editing software will likely be a little bit different from the screenshots we've provided.</p>
<p>When opening our example glowmap working file from the glowmap resource mentioned earlier in this section, you’ll find the following layer setup with a number of image layers inside of folders:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:234px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcsK0hfDG4khEuCu4aFsygmjGrYE-C2cb5pqKwD3EJRMfRWTBt9Q7TQ8NwOd94ZNQ2OUgvdGaj7OvZfGbMCi-yrVAPI3rjaf1ZT_BTRah1Fiy3nsoPT6rXkDw3-b0wQ3vIGaLS8?key=j4J4jVdHF6eMIcKFfNctTg"></figure>
<p>Whereas the glowmap included within these resources itself will look like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:402px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPhDdhMfBlzncTw5Lgp-1cjHk1IeC7fS4y1NeWks2dfaVjx8CRAvIVRypVfIE-INdlS8q9TAsmnoOkyo56N8gcLM6C9Gl6n0owYIshaQMBSAJToNWhxjtAWctBs0RODNtCb7fJHQ?key=j4J4jVdHF6eMIcKFfNctTg"></figure>
<p>As you can see by the colors, it contains glowing freckles on the Red (Glow) channel, and a forehead Tattoo on the Blue (Additional Tattoo) channel.</p>
<p>In-game, this example Glowmap will look like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:293px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfC-xHlngcrJJJBUMYcrGPZncGr7DmsCWIZizbejzsAZ5P6Im_oKTdkxomZlNJ6RyAYs22K4f2hUgxX-XcWDXRIqodnxqRVDQN8qEzolr7KC6Rz_0Du6wUXd2nh4RyOq2e8UWyt?key=j4J4jVdHF6eMIcKFfNctTg"></figure>
<p>The merged glowmap file doesn't contain folders and individual layers as the working file does; instead, you'll only see a singular layer containing both designs on different channels. The image you see when opening the file will be the same as the second image in this section, showing both designs on the glowmap in red or blue respectively.</p>
<p>To customize the glowmap, you can choose one of two options depending on how you would like to customize the glowmap. This process will be the same for both the glow tattoo (red channel) and the additional tattoo (blue channel), with the only difference being the channel you ultimately paste your design onto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Using an existing Vanilla or modded Tattoo/Makeup Design</h5>
<p>This option is the easier of the two, as it doesn't require you to create your own design from scratch. If you'd like to do so instead, the appropriate section further down will cover that process.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: If you're using a modder's tattoo or makeup design not initially created for use with the KAVT glowmap, it is best practice to ask for permission before editing their work. Check out the permission tab on the mod page, and if permission to edit their files isn't provided there, we highly recommend asking the creator - especially if you're somebody who likes to share screenshots of their Tavs on social media or in discord servers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this example, we'll be using a design included in the extended KAVT tattoo atlas. You will need the atlas that contains the tattoo or makeup design you'd like to use as a glowing or additional tattoo via the KAVT glowmap, and the KAVT glowmap merged file contained in the resource we mentioned earlier in this section. You won't need to use the working file unless you want to make edits to the design you've chosen (please ask for permission first!).</p>
<p>Open both the atlas you'd like to select a tattoo or makeup design from and the merged glowmap file. The atlas we're using looks like this when opened and only contains one layer:</p>

<p>Once both files are open, we can proceed with copying the design of your choice from the atlas that contains it. Before doing this, we'd recommend enabling Guides (the dividing lines shown in the atlas image above) as they make it much easier to see where each design starts and ends. In Photoshop, you can do this by navigating to View &gt; Guides &gt; New Guide Layout. The window that opens looks as follows, with the settings shown being appropriate for an atlas that is KAVT-sized (4 tiles wide, 8 tiles tall):</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:390px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlcWCL9nWQjT3ld1b2dd9NwteBxeewjynl4umKUqlaHNPFRNPjORE2M_rKTHUuoOT2UyR5P4Ry3tC-InUvdo3cMC7n70_lN3DhUtVIs33kavF82VTyUsVBzoNfnyEK-hOpaIUnKQ?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q"></figure>
<p>If the atlas you're taking your design from is a different size, you can adjust the size accordingly by increasing or decreasing the width (in tiles, called Columns) and height (in tiles, called Rows).</p>
<p>Next, we'll find our design. For our example, we'll be using one of the goblin facepaint tattoo options included in the KAVT tattoo atlas. As you can see from the color of the design within its tile, this tattoo is contained within the Red channel of this atlas; if the design is blue or green, it occupies the respective channel instead.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeBLKZrVy09fo6jd9t9U6o_l6EXcjOJvu7K4gZNfNQY6ZOUgOk26j71Xz_5TPhfXrKmyCJE-2dS1dnLI2wnS487ttS2AwoifV-L710UJz27zrd9B1oIit3XgSf98oPhvQSUFgHRIg?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">

<p>Open the Channels tab to the right of the Layers tab towards the bottom right of your window.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:436px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdVKlM00lSiUlodnFnWfdchBtzs4QuFJCmmJGChssOkOOXp_nY3t0N5Hr2OtgGgdd9cvRnn2gW4D5WnJw8pudbR4QyS22OkxlICvyrBUKUb-RZbjOEtLtXE30DGDjJRTtiiR6pbbQ?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Atlas channels</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Select the channel your design of choice is located in, then swap back to the Layers tab. Your atlas should now only show the designs located on the appropriate channel, which in our case is the red channel. They will appear in white:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:586px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1IP40i3CK7WYWhs1LUZ_SEys__ecgcTyufkWyI-4T5JYLIMb-iQcQf94MJ8REE5y9BzOSRRv8wTQ75FAUByoG64CWQZusH-3mYyxT8TCdTB6-YMDHA8M9j2Gkj2JcxfVHMWu6?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Example atlas red channel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can select our design's tile. To do this, select the selection/marquee tool from the tool bar. We recommend zooming into the design until it occupies the majority of your screen, as that makes selecting it in its entirety easier. Using the selection/marquee tool, select only the tile of the design you've chosen; if you enabled Guides, this will be clearly marked and your selection tool will “snap” to the Guides you've set, making selecting only your design of choice easier. Once you have selected the design, copy it either via hotkey (ctrl+c), or by navigating to Edit &gt; Copy.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcWU1bE-b654ZY1MFoUkixscDcsi9foP1sb70GPEXkcQ7XwNedDPLqK5MrdXaG1ZmDPs_IpZqz-7Lo5X_LOWAB1sCPSnrqfFZcRt-CgNEk6NnIzJVwa8zNNDrqo6RQmO2h4TyA8Pg?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Selected Design</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With our design of choice copied, you can now swap back to the glowmap merged file. Open the channels tab, and click the channel you'd like to use for this design. The red channel is used for the glowing tattoo, and the blue channel is used for the additional tattoo; we'll be using the blue channel for this example. Your image will change, once again only showing the channel you've chosen. Paste your design into the channel you've chosen, then select the RGB channel to view the full glowmap.</p>
<p>⚠️ <u>Potential Issue</u>: When pasting your design, you may find that the design you've chosen doesn't fit the glowmap and only occupies part of the image. This may look like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcz-RF3iz4d_4r64aWiEohtywq9ApiqW5MQ02LPb1MbDrYXN_SHIHS7sg12j2UIluSuPDLBmzBt0eBl66EtaqbNxZWUxtRpWMR6aGC2nlBQHJr99fbwN8zvcCR_WBqvdvtwY2bM?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Size mismatch</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If this happens, undo the paste either via hotkey (ctrl+z) or by navigating to Edit &gt; Undo. You will need to resize your glowmap to match the size of your design. You can do so to navigating to Image &gt; Image Size. In our example case, the design we've chosen is only half the size of the glowmap, meaning we'll need to reduce the size of the glowmap by 50%:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1R3zywb22mN-kXIiAAB1aYiq4UA_p8Eg4B-caNHvi6lq3Qcb2rKX_Z-ZRV1oIq80-kRgDSLvyNdY8-6W9JaNrlm2ym6gQQJ9OtAc0JpI-rWmbqdHqBcUFZj1icmDTR171JmeHcQ?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q"></figure>
<p>Once you've appropriately re-sized your glowmap, you can repeat the pasting step. The result may look like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDXeeVwZY0mM9nMm1sNcmUIWCDxH7S2WiZ5XNTrArfoi4wWi_TRKRD_CspOk0Iif6cbYYKUhHLQRUfK378odsOAmcAISKHoc989-f5ubfZXXf_pZ9ss1_z-PN6fbmT8E4xBndEeQ?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">

<p>If you want to empty a channel because you don't want to use this option, you can do so by navigating to the channel you'd like to empty, selecting the canvas using the selection/marquee tool, and then hitting the delete key. You will be prompted to choose a fill color; choose black for an empty glowmap channel.</p>

<h5>Drawing your own Design</h5>
<p>If you'd like to draw your own design, we'd recommend using the working file instead, as within this file, each channel is separated into it's own folder. This means that you can more easily create additional layers to work with. Please note that drawing your own design is definitely more advanced than using existing tattoo or makeup designs from the vanilla game or other creators' mods due to the placement requirements of the designs. We'd recommend using the head UV template for tattoo and makeup designs included in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6387?tab=files">this resource</a> by neonbutchery to make sure things line up correctly. It looks like this:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXduIp7nI8mLdH8kYZYQwaU1dY2EgqCexzqOSFGsMahpHNyQE1il4lmjmZAZO3AvcBXXX3AHDkfHgetEGJmWLtfQnRyyEV9abSbvFqdHHoo9qCAtwc86svRyeSbyBm_Z8CRVvCBtOQ?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Face UV Map</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You'll want to draw your design in white on a black background. On the glowmap, <u>anything not fully black</u> will appear as part of your design. You can use this to your advantage and create designs with varying levels of opacity by working not only in true white, but also in shades of grey, but it is also important to consider this to avoid accidental spots appearing within your design!&nbsp;</p>
<p>👏 <u>Tip:</u> If you struggle with the high contrast of a white design on a solid black background, we'd recommend working in colors that are more comfortable to look at for you instead. As long as you make sure your design is white and your background is black once you're done creating your custom design, everything will work as intended.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfrnvVKsBf042UvO7JrB7TnxIWfvshnlE8tSplREqI62kzNzHeBH6qM0hibv-Eha7CFf_vpeaM3IjbEXdOcihro-pRc8LgULJNVogs95ae9qymjNmdTmHsSnQiEhnh49iGaSmA4eg?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">

<p>Once you've finished your design, you can open the merged glowmap file included in the resource. This file only contains the one layer.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:446px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfvWWQJVl3HJJ6_pka3ztMmudtlajNB2Olm6P3VY8SMmxZUuV5aIajRK9FUVDfr4SedaQ_J8THJlU8IVKW-QctFzwEa7dUbQWvt8EuLkEeg6WXJiM0MRS0u7iYud-T5JWBndQti1A?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Merged glowmap file layers</figcaption>

<p>Click on this layer, then click the Channels tab shown on the right side of the Layers tab on the screenshot above. This tab will look like this when opened:</p>

  <figcaption>Merged glowmap channels</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Click on the channel corresponding to which “slot” you'd like this design to use; choose the red channel if you'd like the tattoo to glow and pulse, or the blue channel if you'd like the design to appear as a non-glowing tattoo. Then, first swap back to the Layers tab within this file, and then swap back over to the working file, where your drawn design currently resides. Make sure the design you've created is merged down, meaning it only occupies one layer that contains both the black background and the white design.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdna3fx0Nk2QjAzo1PiurtEbKd66wq1sND3J3OYimLailbhpKmrsjDsShuxltWGJiHlnjxzzZcU9hTe1zuoNODzcdKoAEjvLQ6tHgBH3mqlfZA3FaLoV8TSDxGzJcwNYySfj0-1oA?key=O2Ip_U1nt9qFp1lokIS75Q">
  <figcaption>Example of correct and incorrect layers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, select the entire image using the selection/marquee tool, then copy it either via hotkey (ctrl+c) or by navigating to Edit &gt; Copy. Then, swap back to the merged file we previously opened.</p>
<p>‼️<u>Note</u>: If you have more experience with image editing software, you may be tempted to simply select your layer and hit ctrl+c. We don't recommend doing it this way, because the individual channels will at times not accept the copied image if it has been copied this way. We explicitly recommend selecting the entire canvas and copying it that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the merged file, simply paste the design you've copied into the file. As we previously selected the channel we'd like it to occupy, the design should automatically paste into this channel. If not, re-select the channel as mentioned earlier, and try pasting your design again. You can double-check whether your design made it to the correct channel by opening the Channels tab once again, and clicking the RGB channel - this will make all channels within the vile visible. Your design should now appear in red or blue, depending on which channel you chose for your design.</p>

<h4><strong><u>The Body Glowmap</u></strong></h4>
<p>The Body Glowmap is available for both KAVT and KAVT NVP, thanks to Kaz.</p>
<p>When opening our example working file, you’ll find the following layer setup:</p>

<p>The body tattoos used for these examples were created by Jerinski, who kindly allowed us to use his work for example content.</p>
<p><strong><u>Export &amp; Compression Types</u></strong></p>
<p>When saving your Glowmaps as .DDS files, please use BC3 compression.</p>
<p>I would recommend saving these textures without MipMaps, as they can sometimes make content like this appear blurry.</p>
