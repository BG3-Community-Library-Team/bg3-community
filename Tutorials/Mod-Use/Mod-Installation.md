Mod Installation
> 
> *This is a guide meant for Windows steam users and BG3MM. However, GOG users can use this guide as well; they just need to find the GOG equivalent of the Steam paths.*
{.is-info}


This guide will cover 3 things: 

1. How to set up BG3MM 
2. How to install .pak files. 
3. How to install manual/loose file mods (mods that do not come as .pak file but as folders). 

##  **Set up of BG3MM (Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager):**

###### 1. Install BG3MM via github


Link: https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/tag/1.0.10.0
Latest release: October 20, 2023. 
Version: 1.0.10.0 

> You will need these: .NET Framework 4.7.2 and NET. 7.0.13 
> Usually these will already be installed on your Windows system, but if you encounter problems with the usage of BG3MM, make sure you have .NET Framework 4.7.2 and NET. 7.0.13 installed.

You will see this when you open the link:

You will need to press on "BG3ModManager_Latest.zip" that is highlighted in red in the bottom. 

This will prompt a download. It will be a zip file. 


##### 2. Set BG3MM up correctly

Now you need to extract the zip file. The zip file should be in your downloads folder Ã­n file explore. 

Windows support zip files: all you need to do is right click, and click on "Extract all" and then press "Extract" in the menu as shown below.

Now you have BG3ModManager_Latest as a folder. 
Delete the zip file, you no longer need it. 

Move the folder to an area where you can remember it; for example on the desktop, or in the documents folder. 
> 
> It is important you do not extract it inside any folders related to BG3 as this is an external program. 
Likewise do not put the folder into any steam, Larian Studios or BG3 related folders. 
> Do not move the exe out of the folder either. It belongs in the folder and should never be removed.

##### 3. Configuring BG3MM. 

Open the folder "BG3ModManager_Latest". 
And double click on the exe:

![bg3mm_exe.png](/tutorials/bg3mm_exe.png)

Your BG3MM should look something like this:

> You will notice that there is two "mods" that are already installed. These are base files which got added in patch 5. They will get hidden next BG3MM update. 
> They should be ignored, and not set to active and stay in the inactive section.
> LaughingLeader has a way to hide them already, if needed (explanation below): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/master/src/GUI/Resources/IgnoredMods.json.
