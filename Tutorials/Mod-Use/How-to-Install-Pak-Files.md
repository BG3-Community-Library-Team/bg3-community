# How to install .Pak files via BG3MM

This is part 2 of the guide "How to install Mods in BG3". 
First part: https://wiki.bg3.community/e/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/Installation-Of-BG3MM

> This guide is for Windows, Steam users and BG3MM users. 
> However it will point out in the guide if there is an alternative way for Vortex.
> GOG users is basically the same, provided you followed the first guide. 
{.is-info}


## 1. Find the mod you wish to install

Best website for mods is nexus. 
You will find a wide varity on there: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3

You will need an account to download the mods, so make one before you move on with the guide. 
If you have one, log in so you can download the mods. 

> Remember to read the mod description of the mod you wish to download! 
> The mod description outlines things such as: Installation, compatbility issues, load order (if it has a specific load order), other things you may wish to keep in mind such as bugs. 
> A lot of issues can be prevented if you remember to the read the description!

## 2. Download the mod 

When you have found the mod you wish to download, then you click onto the mod page. 
Here you will see a description of the mod. If you scroll a little down, right above the description itself, you will see a bar with different tabs; "Description", "Files", "Images", "Videos", "Posts", etc.

Click on the highlighted "Files" as in the above screenshot. 

Here you will see where the files themselves are stored. 
You will notice that there is a button called "Mod Manager Download" - do not use this if you are using BG3MM. This is for Vortex users. You need to press the "Manual Download" if you are using BG3MM as highlighted below: 

![download.png](/tutorials/download.png =x515)

The mod will install as a zip or a 7zip file most of the time. Other times it can be as a .rar file which is almost the same as a zip file, so it is recommended to install 7zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) so that you are able to extract the mod from the archive (zip, 7zip, rars). 
However, most of the time your Windows PC should support these type of files. 

> Vortex users should use the mod manager download button and ignore rest of the guide. This may seem like the easy way out, but Vortex has it cons (bugs) in the long run and most modders recommend BG3MM. However if used correctly, and being aware of the bugs, Vortex can be used for most mods.

## 3. Install the mod

There are a few ways to install the mod. This guide will outline two of these. 
Just choose one of the ways; in the long run it does not matter much. 

The mod will be downloaded as a zip, 7zip or rar file in most cases. 

- 3.1 Extraction/double click and manually place it in the mods folder. 

First you will see the mod in your downloads folder. 

![trashcan_download.png](/tutorials/trashcan_download.png)

Right click on it, and click "extract all"

![trashcan_extract.png](/tutorials/trashcan_extract.png =x400)


Out will come a folder or .pak file and maybe a few others files. If a folder comes out, go one folder deep until you find a .pak file. 
Delete everything besides the .pak file as that is the only thing you need. 
(Provided the mod description does not specify otherwise)

> Tip: You can also double click on the zip, 7zip or rar file, and it will open up inside the zip file. No need for deleting anything in here. Just remember the .pak file is the only thing what you need, and ignore the rest.
{.is-info}

When you have extracted it, open BG3MM, and click on "Mods folder" in the bar to the top, right beside "Shortcuts" as highlighted below: 

![bg3mm_modsfolder.png](/tutorials/bg3mm_modsfolder.png)

It will open this folder: 

![modsfolder.png](/tutorials/modsfolder.png =x200)

This is the mod folder. The folder path will always be: 

`%localAppData%/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods`

This is something that is determined by Larian and cannot be changed.

> In this folder, only .pak files are installed. 
> No folders, subfolders, json, readme's, txt, zip, 7zip, rar, etc files. 
> Only file type allowed in the mods folder are .pak files.

Now that you have opened the mods folder, just simply take the .pak file from your downloads folder or zip folder, and place it in the mods folder as seen below in the two screenshots:

Now you have done that, then you just need to open BG3MM again and refresh it.
