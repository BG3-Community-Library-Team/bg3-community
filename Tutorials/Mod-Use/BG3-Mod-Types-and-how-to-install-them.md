# How to use mods in Baldur's Gate 3

![soon_tm.webp](/test/alithea/soon_tm.webp)


Modding games is a wonderful way to enhance and individualize your game experience, it's also never entirely safe. Especially if the game is still regularly patched like Baldur's Gate 3. 
Mods modify game files, if those game files are altered by a patch or hotfix, it can cause the mod to not being able to work properly anymore. This may lead to being unable to load a savegame or cause gameplay issues. It is important to check if updates are needed each time Larian provides a patch or hotfix.
Please understand that modding comes with the possibility of something not working right. Which can cause frustration and wasted time and effort and it can potentially screw something up in your game.
This guide will hopefully help to prevent that.

## Minimize the risks with a few simple steps:
### Backup your savegames
before
- starting to mod an ongoing playthrough
- adding new or more complex mods
- updating your game

Go to your story folder, highlight everything and copy it to a separate location. Default savegame folder path: 
```C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story```

### Read mod descriptions
Mod authors usually provide crucial information about their creations in the description. Please read it and pay extra attention to 
- install instructions
- requirements
- load order
- compatibility between mods

It also doesn't hurt to read sticky posts in the comments and to have a quick glance at the most recent entries.

### Disable auto-updating your game
- Steam: go to Library - Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 - right click Properties - Updates - select *Only update this game when i launch it*
- GOG: go to Settings - Game features - uncheck *Auto-update games*

Alternatively the game can be started directly from the bg3.exe or bg3_dx11.exe found in the games bin folder.
Default bin folder path:
```C:\Program files\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldur's Gate 3\bin```
