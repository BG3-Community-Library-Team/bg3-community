# How to use mods in Baldur's Gate 3

![soon_tm.webp](/test/alithea/soon_tm.webp)


Modding games is never entirely safe. Especially if the game is still regularly patched like Baldur's Gate 3. 
Mods modify game files, if those game files are altered by a patch or hotfix, it can cause the mod to not being able to work properly anymore. This may lead to being unable to load a savegame or cause gameplay issues.
Thus it is important to check if updates are needed each time Larian provides a patch or hotfix.

## Minimize the risks with a few simple steps:
* Backup your savegames
before you start modding an ongoing playthrough, add more complex mods, or update your game.
Default savegame folder path: 
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story

* Read mod descriptions
pay extra attention to install instructions, requirements and possible incompatibility between mods

* Disable auto-updating your game
Steam: go to Library - Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 - right click Properties - Updates - select *Only update this game when i launch it*
GOG: go to Settings - Game features - uncheck *Auto-update games*
