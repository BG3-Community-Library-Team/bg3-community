# How to use mods in Baldur's Gate 3


Modding games is a wonderful way to enhance and individualize your game experience, it's also never entirely safe. Especially if the game is still regularly patched like Baldur's Gate 3. 
Mods modify game files, if those game files are altered by a patch or hotfix, it can cause the mod to not being able to work properly anymore. This may lead to being unable to load a savegame or cause gameplay issues. It is important to check if updates are needed each time Larian provides a patch or hotfix.
Please understand that modding comes with the possibility of something not working right. Which can cause frustration and wasted time and effort and it can potentially screw something up in your game.
This guide will hopefully help to prevent that.

## Minimize the risks with a few simple steps:
### Backup your savegames
before
- starting to mod an ongoing playthrough
- adding new or more complex mods
- updating your game

Go to your story folder, highlight everything and copy it to a separate location. Default savegame folder path: 
```C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story```

### Read mod descriptions
Mod authors usually provide crucial information about their creations in the description. Please read it and pay extra attention to 
- install instructions
- requirements
- load order
- compatibility between mods

It also never hurts to read sticky posts in the comments and to have a quick glance at the most recent entries.

### Disable auto-updating your game
- Steam: go to Library - Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 - right click Properties - Updates - select *Only update this game when i launch it*
- GOG: go to Settings - Game features - uncheck *Auto-update games*

Alternatively the game can be started directly from the bg3.exe or bg3_dx11.exe found in the games bin folder.
Default bin folder path:
```C:\Program files\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldur's Gate 3\bin```

## Where to find and download mods

[BG3 Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3)

## Mod types and how to install them

### Tab {.tabset}
#### PAK
Pak files are conveniently packaged data bundles. They are used with a mod manager and make installing and uninstalling Mods very convenient. Paks can include a variety of modifications to game elements such as textures, sounds, objects, and many others.

Installation:

1. Install the mod manager of your choice. We recommend Laughing Leader's Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager. [Follow this guide on how to install and set up BG3MM.](https://wiki.bg3.community/en/Tutorials/Mod-Use/Installation-Of-BG3MM)
2. Go to the mod page, read it, and download the desired version of the mod you want. Use **Manual download** and save the archive to a location outside of program or game files.
3. Open the archive and drag or copy the .pak into your Mods Folder. Make sure that there aren't any subfolders or files other than .pak in the mod folder.
Default Mod folder path:
```C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods```
4. Start BG3MM or if it is already running, click refresh to see the new mod. It most likely will appear in Inactive Mods to the right.
Optional: *Save Order As* to make sure you have a working order to go back to just in case.
5. Drag the mod from Inactive Mods to Active Mods. Keep load order requirements in mind while doing so. [General Load Order Guide](/Tutorials/Mod-Use/general-load-order)
> Some mods are *overrides*. They will appear in a separate section called Overrides at the bottom of the Active Mods panel.
*DiceSet_06* and *Honor* in the Inactive Mods panel to the right are game files.
Don't move either of them into the Active Mods panel.
{.is-warning}
6. Make sure that Mod Fixer is installed.
7. Save and export the load order to your game.
8. Start the game either directly through BG3MM or use your prefered method.

#### MOD FIXER
>Games updated to Patch 7 do not need Mod fixer anymore. Mods including mod fixer should still work fine as long as the used file is called ForceRecompile.txt
{.is-warning}

Mod fixer is still neccessary up to patch 6. If it isn't installed, character creation will not be available. Instead this lovely view will appear on screen:

![durgeharem.webp](/mod-use/install-mods/durgeharem.webp)

Installation:
1. [download mod fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/141)
2. move ModFixer.pak into the mod folder

That's it.

[Norbyte, the creator of Mod fixer explains how it works in his post on Larian Studio's discord](https://discord.com/channels/98922182746329088/767804218819477515/784392518883868674)

#### LOOSE FILES

Mods that come as loose files are moved to your Data folder and do not need to be installed with a mod manager. The exact subfolder is usually part of the mod description and included in the archive.

Default Data folder path:
```C:\Program files\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldur's Gate 3\Data```

Depending on which mods are installed, the contents of this may vary greatly.
#### NATIVE MODS

Few mods such as [Native Camera Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945) are application extensions and come in the format .dll, they go in your bin folder and the tool [Native Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944) is required to load them.

[Please follow the instructions on how to install the tool carefully.](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/944)

#### MANUAL INSTALLATION
The manual istallation of mods is an alternative in case you can't use a mod manager.

???? I have no idea, never done that. Help!

#### SCRIPT EXTENDER

Script Extender by Norbyte adds Lua/Osiris scripting support to the game. It is a necessary requirement for a multitude of other mods.
SE works on Windows, Linux, and Steam Deck. [Follow this guide on how to install SE.](/Tutorials/Mod-Use/How-to-install-Script-Extender)
> Download SE only from [Norbyte's official GitHub](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases) or via the BG3 Mod Manager.

## Modding and Achievements
Modding Baldur's Gate 3 disables all achievements. They are automatically re-enabled when using Script Extender. If Script Extender cannot be used for any reason, the native mod Achievement Enabler can also be used for enabling achievements again. Please do not use those two methods together.

Happy modding!
