# How to install manual/loose file mods

This is part 3 and the final part on how to install BG3MM, mods and loose file mods.

## What is loose/manual mods? 

What is loose file mods? Loose file mods are mods that are not managed by a mod manager. This can for example be tattoo mods or make up mods. You can identify them with coming in a zip, 7zip or rar and when you extract them they typically have folders which can be named; "Data", "Bin", "Public", "Generated". 
When you open these folders, it will typically be a bunch of folders ending with different files such as DDS or other files. Meaning, these will not end in files that are ".pak" files. 

These folders shouold not be put in the mods folder (`%localAppData%/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods`) but instead the data or the bin folder in your root installation folder (`\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`)

However Vortex can manage them, but it is not a good idea as there are potential risk such as Vortex putting the folders and files in a wrong place which can but is not limited to these bugs: 

BG3 crashing
BG3 not responding
BG3 not opening
Weird textures
Mods not working correctly
Mods not showing up
Mods having compatbility issues when there should be none etc. 

This is where this guides comes in to provide information with how to install these manually. 
For Unique Tav which also have a loose file aspect, look through this guide instead: (On To-Do)

## 1. Find and download the mod you wish to install from Nexus

Nexus Website: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3

For this guide, Coven Elf tattoo and make up mod will be the example. 

You will need to press on "manual download" as highlighted below. Do not press "download with mod manager" if there is such an option. That is for vortex and through a mod manager, which is not recommended with loose file mods.
