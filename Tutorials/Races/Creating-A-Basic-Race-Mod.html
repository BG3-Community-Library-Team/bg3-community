<p>So, you got a great idea for a new custom race for Baldur's Gate 3. Great! The only problem is, you have no idea how to actually <i>make </i>a custom race.</p>
<p>Sound like you? Well you're in the right place.</p>
<h2>The Template</h2>
<p>EmeraldTechno has created a handy race template to go along with this tutorial. You can download the template here: <a href="https://github.com/EmeraldTechnopath/CMTY-Race-Template">https://github.com/EmeraldTechnopath/CMTY-Race-Template</a></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:46.7%;"><img src="/tutorials/creating_a_basic_race_mod/cabrm_downloading_the_template.png"></figure>
<p>Just visit the link, click the green Code button, and then click Download ZIP.</p>
<p>Unzip the zip file, delete the README.md, and you're ready to start following the tutorial.</p>
<h2>Seeing What We've Got</h2>
<p>Just to see what the template has already set up for you, go ahead and pack the mod using Modder's Multitool or LSLib. Then load it into BG3 Mod Manager, save, export, and run the game.</p>
<p>Start a new game, and you'll see a new Custom Race option at the end of all the vanilla races.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/tutorials/creating_a_basic_race_mod/cabrm_custom_race_in_cc.png"></figure>
<p>This Custom Race is going to look a lot like a default Human, but that's okay. We can tweak the visuals as much as we want later.</p>
<p>The template has all of the required components to create that basic Custom Race, and no more than that. You can already see that the race doesn't have any subraces, race features, passives, or spells. We'll get into adding extra parts to the race later on in the tutorial.</p>
<p>But for now, let's close the game and open the template in your preferred code viewer.</p>
<h2>Understanding The Files</h2>
<p>Open the Community_Race_Template folder in your preferred code viewer, such as Notepad++ or VSCode.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/tutorials/creating_a_basic_race_mod/cabrm_template_files_example.png"></figure>
<p>In this example from VSCode, we can see all of the files that are contained within the template. You can see that we have six files, and we'll go over each of them in detail.</p>
