# Character Visuals Not Showing Fix 
*Guide written by EvilSnail0fDestruktion*

1. With the character visual in question open, set the _Base in the 1st drop-down to the left to whatever you are using for your animation set base.

2. Click Filter

3. search and double click to add your _Base again in the first window

4. Below that, add Filters that reflect the naming prefix of anything you want to be able to select

5. To the lower right by 1, add the body gr2 by searching and double clicking

6. Save & Close

7. Chose the body from the lower drop down

8. At the bottom, add any slots you need and don't have with the +. Anything with prefixes matching your filters and matching the slot should show here now! 

[Needs Screenie, could take one w filter open and point numbered arrows for each step]
