# How to install the Larian Studios - Baldurs Gate 3 Toolkit on Linux

To get things out of the way immediately... how you can install the Toolkit varies depending on your distro.
Each distro tab will feature only its own way of installing it, so choose the one whichever fits yours.
In addition to this, this guide is created based on a snapshot of our current understanding. If there are changes to the toolkit or your distro (updates) or you are using a different version than what we were able to make run, this might be something you have to figure out yourself or ask around for.
